In the spirit of great visionaries who’ve shaped our future, this master plan outlines an ambitious experiment: demonstrating what becomes possible when skilled people unite around a compelling goal, with access to necessary resources and freedom to work as they see fit. Through six interconnected projects, we’re creating a living laboratory that will pioneer the transition from competition to unconditional collaboration, proving that “Unity Makes Strength” isn’t just a motto – it’s a blueprint for transformation.


## 6 projects for 1 experiment

1. **[The Experiment](/master-plan-2025/the-experiment):** Our foundational project – proving that removing artificial constraints unleashes human potential for extraordinary achievements.
2. **[Collaborative Van Build](/master-plan-2025/collaborative-van-build):** Our flagship project – a state-of-the-art camper van built through community-driven, expert-led collaboration.
3. **[Makers Paradise](/master-plan-2025/makers-paradise):** The physical hub – our first prototype collaborative space, the birthplace of our vision. A living lab where makers from all domains live, work, and innovate together.
