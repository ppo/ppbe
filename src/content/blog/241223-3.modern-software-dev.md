## Core Methodologies

### Agile Development

Agile is a mindset emphasizing:
- Individuals and interactions over processes
- Working software over documentation
- Customer collaboration over contracts
- Responding to change over following plans


### Scrum Framework

Scrum provides structure through:
- Fixed-length sprints (typically 2 weeks)
- Daily stand-ups for coordination
- Regular planning and review sessions
- Clear roles and responsibilities


### Lean Startup

Focuses on validation through:
- Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop
- Minimum Viable Product (MVP) approach
- Validated learning
- Innovation accounting


### Design Thinking

Ensures user-centered solutions through:
- Deep user understanding (Empathize)
- Problem definition and framing
- Creative solution generation
- Rapid prototyping and testing

☝️ See our dedicated article for a deeper dive into the [Design Thinking methodology](design-thinking-overview).


## Development Lifecycle

### 1. Project Initiation

**Discovery Phase:**
- User research and problem definition
- Market analysis
- Technical feasibility assessment
- Initial hypothesis formation

**Team Formation:**
- Product Owner: Value and vision
- Scrum Master: Process facilitation
- Development Team: Technical execution
- UX/Design: User experience


### 2. MVP Development

**Core Feature Definition:**
- Essential functionality mapping
- User story creation
- Technical architecture planning
- Risk assessment

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Minimal technical foundation
- Critical user flows
- Basic infrastructure
- Core interactions


### 3. Agile Development Cycle

**Sprint Planning:**
- Backlog prioritization

## Conclusion

Modern software development succeeds by combining the structure of Scrum, the flexibility of Agile, and the validation focus of Lean Startup, all while maintaining a user-centered approach. This integrated methodology enables teams to build complex applications efficiently while ensuring they deliver real value to users.

Success comes from maintaining balance between competing priorities: speed vs. quality, features vs. infrastructure, user needs vs. technical constraints. Regular inspection and adaptation of both process and product ensure continuous improvement and sustainable development.
