## Objectives

Window covers seem basic and taken for granted, but theyâ€™re like an iceberg â€“ thereâ€™s so much more
beneath the surface! They can serve many purposes: block light (from partial to full blackout),
reduce sound transfer, insulate in both cold and hot climates, prevent bugs from entering, and
integrate with window ventilation systems.

The fascinating challenge: they need to be easy to mount/unmount, compact to store, and modular
enough to adapt to different contexts (summer camping, winter stealth mode, basic privacy, or
alone in nature).

ðŸ‘‰ _See our approach in [How Will This Work?](/vanbuildrethink/van-build-rethink#how-will-this-work)_


## Starting Questions

- **What are the different use contexts and their specific requirements?** Privacy vs stealth vs climate control vs bug protection
- **Which needs are currently well met by existing solutions, and which arenâ€™t?** Where are the gaps in functionality? What can be improved?
- **What kind of modularity should we design for?** How do we make one system adapt to multiple scenarios?
- **What makes window covers truly easy to mount/unmount and store?** Beyond just â€œmagnets and folding".
- **How do different physics principles and materials actually work?** Whatâ€™s really happening with heat, light, air, soundâ€¦?


## Approach

**First principles analysis:** Whatâ€™s the science involved? What do we absolutely know is true?

**Use case exploration:** Understanding the full spectrum of how a van can be used and what is needed from window covers.
 
**Integration thinking:** How window covers work as part of a complete system with ventilation, insulation, etc â€“ as well as daily living patterns.

**Practical testing:** Real-world experimentation with different approaches and materials.
