🔗 _<a href="master-plan-2026">Master Plan 2026</a>_


#### 29–30 Dec

I finalized my [Master Plan 2026](master-plan-2026) and Coronation Source Code – in Le Lavandou, France [📸](https://www.instagram.com/p/DSztBSzDN6E/).


#### 31 Dec

I drove to the [Pic de Bugarach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pic_de_Bugarach) and slept there.

Why?

- 2026 is a “Year 1” (2+0+2+6 = 1+0 = 1), so on January 1st, it’s a 1-1-1 Portal.
- Bugarach is one of Earth’s most powerful energy vortexes – the “upside-down mountain” with inverted geological layers.
- Woo-woo: Cathar sacred site, known for interdimensional portal energy, etc.

Did something happen that night?  
Yes 😁 I had some “activations” during the night – something like freeing trapped negative energy.


#### 01 Jan

I hiked 10.1km

At 11:11, on the top: I read my Coronation Source Code and meditated.

Did something happen?  
Well, I didn’t come back with tablets of the commandments 🫤

I drove across Spain to Lagos, Portugal – passing through potential locations for Unity Playground #0.
