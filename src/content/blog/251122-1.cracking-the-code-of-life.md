**_Here’s what I wrote on November 17th, 2025…_**

I feel like I had a – another – breakthrough. Like all the pieces of the puzzle finally coming together to finally reveal the picture. A moment of deep clarity… like the veil being lifted. Similar to what I had after “powerful psychedelic” sessions – here without taking anything, entirely naturally. I felt like I reached the top of the mountain – after a long, difficult journey. A huge personal work with the help of some people along the way – some unconsciously but also some Sherpas helping with the heavy lifting. It feels like the climax moment in a movie. It’s like standing on top of the mountain – appreciating the view, the calm, the purity of the air, and the power of the present moment. Enjoying a timeless well deserved break before continuing the journey. A mixture of relief about what has happened and excitement about what is to come… the fun part! Surfing down the mountain… like in a video game… with the cheat codes in your mind! 🤩🏂🤙

Let me try to explain what happened. It’s very complex yet very simple at the same time… so probably very close to the “truth”(?) What makes it very difficult to explain is that there are pieces coming from everywhere.

You’ve got several life themes you came to explore. It’s like trying to get out of a maze. If you always take the right direction, you come fast to the end. If you’re taking wrong directions, it’ll take longer… but it’s not bad. Actually, it’s a bit more complicated.

There’s Light and Shadow. Shadow doesn’t really exist, it’s just the absence of Light. The negative is just “what is not”. The wrong direction is just not a direction towards the exit.

Law of One explains there are two polarities – positive and negative. It’s not like good and bad. Positive is expansive, negative is contractive. It’s “what is” and “what is not”. Bashar explains we’re actually not in a duality world but in a trinity – as there’s also the equilibrium state. Positive and negative are the two sides of the same coin – the equilibrium is the coin itself, the All.

Law of One explains there are two paths of evolution from fourth density to sixth – positive and negative. Then all the negative paths flip to the positive side. That’s what I understood at least. But taking into account what Bashar said, it’s maybe rather that everything merges to the equilibrium state in the end… to evolve to the higher octave – first density of the next level.

Regarding our life themes, I feel it similar to that. We can’t do anything wrong, we’re no matter what working on these themes. Like in a maze, we can explore them at a faster pace by taking all the right branches, by immediately experiencing “what is”. Or it can take longer if we explore through “what is not”… until we realize that “it is not”, and then, like in [Othello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi) (aka Reversi), the theme is switched into the positive state. In Gene Keys (related to Human Design), there’s the concept of Shadow, Gift, and Siddhi. That I understand as the trinity – negative, positive, and equilibrium/integration. For example, in my Human Design chart, I have a theme or potential related to being a “salesperson”. I can explore that via the negative side by being manipulative or to use that positively to bring positive outcome for the tribe. Nothing is ever black or white, never explored solely via the negative or positive path. I’ve been manipulative for my personal interests. But I think it doesn’t only happen in an active manner, you also experience it passively – being the manipulated one. Like the Law of One explains, everything is a catalyst triggering something in you. The final objective is to make a choice – not consciously but via the score of your actions (x% positive, y% negative).

All is One, there’s only God who divided himself to make all the experiences possible – there’s nothing good or bad, he wants to experiment everything like a thorough scientist. We all conduct a part of an experiment and later we report the results, we upload them in the cloud, back to Source.

Thinking about quantum physics, Schrödinger’s cat, multiverse, time doesn’t exist – well, what I understood. Like Bashar explains, we create a new reality at every instant – billions of times per second. It’s like reality is just all the possible individual pictures and we choose which ones we want to put in which order – creating the movie of our life. Bashar explains also that when we solve a problem in our life, it’s not like it disappears, it’s rather like we rewrote the past and it never existed. That’s what seems to happen in the multi-slit experiment – what the “Schrödinger’s cat” is about.  Observing the experiment changes the result… even if we observe it after – it’s like the particule knew in the past that it would be observed in the future, as if the future measurement affects the past behavior. Back to our life themes and personal experiences. When we realize something, it’s like placing a disk in Othello that results in all a row being flipped – our history is literally rewritten – that explains also the Mandela effect.

Regarding Othello. I had the vision that it’s like a multilevel Othello game – some boards are personal, some are collective. We can switch our own disks or collective ones. Our disks don’t necessarily immediately switch – sometimes it fades gradually. Same to switch the surrounding disks – it can also apply gradually. When we master the game, we can also decide (consciously or unconsciously, or from our Higher Self?) to take our time to strategically allow more “black disks” to fill the board and to switch them all later – exploring deeper “what is not”, to better understand the “problem”.

I was immediately amazed by my Human Design report. The more I analyzed it, the more fascinating it becomes. Everything is explained there. It doesn’t feel limiting like we’ve no control over our life. It feels more like getting cheat codes for the game – like the NPC (non-player character) in the movie “[Free Guy](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6264654/)” suddenly getting access to player features when he puts on glasses, like Neo seeing the bullets coming in slow motion and being able to avoid them. You now have the owner’s manual of your human avatar, the map of the board and knowledge of the tricks and skills required in this level – a goldmine to master the game.

Realizing that, we can’t judge the situation of anyone or anything any more. There’s no good or bad, just the learning through the “what is” or “what is not” path. And in the end, it’ll be the same.

I don’t know if I just reached awakening – it surely doesn’t feel like I’d imagined. It’s not like being more powerful or knowing everything. It’s like: before you kind of thought you knew, but now you know – and it’s surely just another stage anyway. It’s maybe more about finally knowing the game you’re playing – “oh, that’s what I was supposed to do!” Now you can better identify the right directions in the maze. And you don’t stress anymore about taking a wrong path, as you know the most important thing is to go through, “all in”… either it’s the right one or it will instantly switch like an Othello disk when you _will_ realize it was the “is not” path.

Is it pretentious to think I’m awakened? 🤔  
_Awakening = aware in the dream. Enlightenment = awakened as the dreamer._

We’re all living in our own reality/dream. I’m in my reality – I choose what’s happening in here. I had this thought about what’s going on in the world today – especially seeing the more pronounced division that is occurring. I choose my reality, so I decide what I want to believe in, which kind of future I want to imagine, and therefore create. I’m choosing which pictures I want to put for what’s next in my movie. You do the same – choose carefully. Maybe we’ll end up in the same movie, maybe not – and that’s fine.  

_So that was a month ago… and what happened? Well, honestly, the veil seems to have fallen back in place 🫤_  
_But thoughts (the Universe, my Higher Self?) reminded me several times to read this again – over and over to “water the seed”. And maybe that’s the real cheat code – leaving yourself breadcrumbs._
