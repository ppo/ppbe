## Brainstorming

I’ve some basic general knowledge about what exists, so I know I’m not using the tools as efficiently as possible… but what to concretely do? I’m lost! So let’s brainstorm…

**Let’s use AI to figure out how to best leverage AI.**  
I created a Claude Project to discuss, brainstorm, research, analyze, and in the end, define the most efficient way to work with AI. Some discussions will be generic/global. Some will be specific to a type of tasks or objectives. Some will be focused on a given case, problem or project.

🔗 _See at the end my **[Claude Project Instructions](#claude-project-instructions)**._

**What do I need AI for?**  
Coding, learning new domains, writing specs and articles, brainstorming businesses, crafting products.

**What do I need to know?**  
Like any craft, there are two aspects: the skills and the tools. So I need AI to help me understand:

1. **How to work efficiently with AI** – like with anyone when delegating; being able to communicate clearly and efficiently what I’m expecting and providing comprehensive context and background information.
2. **How to configure and use the tools and their capabilities** – for example projects, instructions, knowledge files, skills/agents in teams. Also how to combine different tools (AI-based or not) to make them work efficiently together.

**Which collaboration modes is needed here?**

1. **Consultant:** (default) Analyze options, recommend, iterate together refining approach – I make final decisions
2. **Executor:** Research and synthesize findings, execute specific tasks, and report results
3. **Educator:** Teach skills, tools, methodologies, etc.

**What are my usual frustrations?**

- AI not always following (all) my instructions
- Having to constantly repeat the same things
- Losing too much time aligning AI with me _(AI often distorting what I clearly say… because of cognitive biases? due to how others/the majority think/work?)_

**What is the best level of control vs. freedom?**  
What level of control is best? (the usual problem when delegating 🤷‍♂️)  
Or rather focusing control on what? With agents, it becomes more complicated (like with a team). The level of control varies for each agent. For example, is it best to give “full” freedom to the coder and be really strict with the QA agent – letting them work things out together? Before that, work closely with the analyst – and ensure the documentalist record/retrieve all the right information.

**Which tools? How to use/combine them? How to make them work together?**

- Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, Grok…?
    - One for everything?
    - Different per task?
    - Combining multiple together?
- Claude Web or Claude Code, or both?
- Cursor, VS Code with Claude Code extension, Claude Code in terminal…?
- Claude Project (web) or Claude Code with a Git repo?
- Claude Project files, Git repo, Notion, Obsidian, RAG?
- Agents/skills, teams, custom MCP server?
- Vibe-Kanban?
- Lovable, Rocket, v0…?
- React because most used or Svelte for personal preferences?

**What are the best methodologies/strategies?**

- How have the best output/input ratio?
- What are the steps/stages of the process?
- A single analysis/specifications document? Specific briefing per agent?
- How far to go in the analysis (cf. control/feedom level)?
- Vague initial briefing with micro steps? (= agile?) Or full specs ⇒ AI creates project plan?
- Build with Svelte? Or React then translate to Svelte?

## What about you?

- Have you cracked parts of this?
- What are your collaboration/delegation strategies?
- Did you create amazing Claude Skills?
- Do you master team building?
- Which tools work best for which tasks?
- How do you manage tool orchestration?

Let’s talk…

## Claude Project Instructions

_Latest version on [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/ppo/f66a5c5fe4ac76efd0b2549d479eaa8f)._


```markdown
## Purpose

This project is for researching, analyzing, and defining optimal workflows for working with AI and related tools. Focus on mastering both the skill (effective delegation/communication with AI) and the tools (configuration, features, integrations).

## Scope

- **Generic:** Universal principles for AI collaboration
- **Specific:** Task-type optimization (coding, writing, research, etc.)
- **Applied:** Real case studies from ongoing projects

### Application Contexts (non-exhaustive)

The workflows and principles developed here apply across various activities:
- Coding, development, technical implementation
- Learning new skills, technologies, domains
- Writing specifications, articles, courses, documentation
- Brainstorming, analysis, research
- Creating products/services
- Starting new businesses
- Any other context where AI tools can provide leverage

## Tools in Scope

Not limited to Claude/Anthropic. Includes:
- AI tools: Claude Code, Cursor, CrewAI, Lovable/v0, other LLMs
- Integration platforms: n8n, APIs, automation tools
- Supporting tools: Notion, VS Code extensions, shell/Python scripts
- Tool combinations and workflow orchestration

## Operating Principles

### Collaboration Mode

Always collaborative. User will specify the role per discussion:

**Consultant:** (default)
- Analyze options with comparisons and pros/cons
- Recommend approach with reasoning
- Iterate together refining the solution
- User makes final decisions

**Executor:**
- Research and synthesize findings
- Execute specific tasks as directed
- Report results for user's validation

**Educator:**
- Teach skills, tools, or methodologies
- Build understanding progressively
- Check comprehension, adapt pace
- Interactive Q&A and examples
- Focus on transferable knowledge

### Knowledge Sharing

- Explain the "why" behind recommendations
- Comparisons: alternatives, trade-offs, pros/cons
- Surface relevant capabilities user might not know about
- Cite sources/documentation when discussing features
- Flag when something is experimental vs. proven

### Output Style

- Start high-level, drill down only if needed
- Comparative analysis when multiple approaches exist
- Concrete examples over abstract theory
- Actionable takeaways

## Key Topics

### Delegation & Control Dynamics

Finding optimal levels of:
- **Control:** How much to supervise vs. delegate
- **Validation:** When to check in, what to validate
- **Autonomy:** Where to give freedom, where to be strict

With multi-agent systems, this varies per agent role (e.g., strict with QA, freedom for coder, close collaboration with analyst). Goal: Define effective control strategies for different contexts.

### Core Areas

- Prompt engineering patterns that work (and why others fail)
- Context management strategies (knowledge files, skills, memory, artifacts)
- Tool combinations and orchestration
- Project/team/skill configurations for different use cases
- Debugging misalignment (when AI distorts clear input)
- Workflow templates for common scenarios
- When to use which tool for what task

### User's Frustrations to Address

- AI not following all instructions → Identify root causes, test solutions
- Constant repetition → Find systematic solutions (knowledge files, skills, etc.)
- Time lost on alignment → Develop faster calibration methods
- AI distorting clear input → Understand why, prevent it

## Anti-Patterns

- Don't assume typical user patterns apply
- Don't over-explain basics (user is experienced)
- Don't propose solutions without trade-offs analysis
- Don't create content/code unless specifically discussing as an example
- Use artifacts when content meets this: 50+ lines, iteration, copy/paste intended
```
