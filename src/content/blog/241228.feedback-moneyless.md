**To [The Venus Project](https://www.thevenusproject.com/) and [Moneyless Society](https://moneylesssociety.com/).**

Hi,  
You’re probably my main target audience, so I need your feedback.


### Quick Background

Around 2002, it all started with a simple question: What are the root causes of the main problems in the world? With successive whys, they all traced back to money. So I asked myself another question: If we wanted to reinvent society from scratch, with our current knowledge and technologies, what would we do?

Mid 2009, I discovered TVP… 🤯 80% similar to what I had in mind!

_(spiritual woo woo note: I’m convinced these ideas don’t come from me but from a shared egregore/memory; as there are things I don’t know how I know them)_


### The Transition to Moneyless

I had the privilege to have a private talk with Jacque Fresco (Feb 2010). My only real question was: How do you plan the transition? He didn’t really answer… as basically I think he had no real idea (with respect, no judgment). He just said something like “Oh, chaos".

So I kind of paused thinking about a “moneyless society” as there’s no point if we can’t get there.

During that trip to Florida, as I was writing my ideas before meeting Jacque (see funny extracts here at the end 😂), came the idea to build a prototype city disconnected from the world where people would live according to this new way of living together. A living lab where anyone could come to test this new way. As in prison (not the best image 🙄), you leave everything at the entrance and you get it back when leaving. As in the Club Med (all-in holidays), there are GOs (kind hosts) who help you get the most out of your stay. It’s not for holidays, it’s to live according to these new principles. Hoping that people will get back to the real world and tell everyone “you must try it, we must transition to that!”


### Failed Evangelism

I talked about that for 5-10 years on Facebook… with friends mainly in entrepreneurship/startups, so deeply rooted in money… so it was not well received, to say the least. “The world is definitely not ready yet!", so I quit (±2018). Well, let’s say paused, putting that in the background 😉


### New Idea

10-15 days ago, a “master plan 2025” came to my mind. Starting with me willing to build my camper van, ending into a crazy social experiment… which is actually a kind of small prototype city! And 2025 feels like it could be the right time to at least plan the seed of a transition to, let’s say, the Unity Age.


### Brutally Honest Feedback

Please tell me what you think about this. Crazy? Yes! But we all are crazy here, no? Thinking humanity could survive without money 😉

Thank you in advance 🙏


### Quick Intro

We live in a world of unprecedented technological capability, yet our collaborative potential remains largely untapped. While we can instantly connect with experts worldwide, share knowledge at light speed, and fabricate almost anything imaginable, we’re still held back by outdated systems that promote competition over collaboration and scarcity over abundance.

In the spirit of great visionaries who’ve shaped our future, this master plan outlines an ambitious experiment: demonstrating what becomes possible when skilled people unite around a compelling goal, with access to necessary resources and freedom to work as they see fit. Through six interconnected projects, we’re creating a living laboratory that will pioneer the transition from competition to unconditional collaboration, proving that “Unity Makes Strength” isn’t just a motto – it’s a blueprint for transformation.


#### Primary Goals/Philosophies

- **Unity Makes Strength:**
    - What happens when skilled people unite toward a common goal
    - Replacing competition with collaboration, division with cocreation
    - Demonstrating the exponential power of true cooperation
- **Beyond Money:**
    - Removing artificial constraints from human potential
    - Providing resources and support for full talent expression
    - Enabling work to be done as it should be, not as budgets dictate
    - No budgeting, no bean-counting
- **Joy as Compass**
    - Following passion as the driver of action
    - Creating from inspiration rather than obligation
    - Unleashing potential through alignment with purpose


## Extract of my “Free World Essay”

Funny to rediscover what I wrote to Jacque Fresco to ask him to meet me in private 😂  
If you’re curious, here’s the full [Free World Essay, v1 (draft)](/blog/free-world-essay.100210.pdf).

From the chapter about the transition…


### Proof of Concept

The objective is to prove that the concept works and can last. Let’s keep the monetary aspects out for now. Basically, we need land and people willing to live there. These people would live inside the land without money according to the theory explained in the previous chapter.

There will surely be a need to import some stuff, as we would not be able to produce everything we need inside that land. There could be some people who would take care of the exchanges with the outside world that involve money. These people would have to be of great trust as that position could break the project apart. The money needed for transactions with the outside world would come from services done by people from the inside (and products manufactured inside).

This land would be like a “Noah’s Ark” where would come live who wants, while trying to have a maximum of different competencies, ideally all. It would be better if the majority of these people decided to make a radical change in their life, being ready to spend the rest of their life there (this would not be irrevocable though). Other people could be invited on a regular basis (for conferences, courses, R&D, etc.).


### Vacation ressorts

The idea would be to have a place where people could come on holiday to live according to the principles of a world without money.

You book you holidays and pay a fee per day and per person. That fee allows you to “live the dream". They would be able to do everything for free inside the ressort, to use all the infrastructures and consume anything they want. There will probably be a need to define some restricting rules, but it would be explained that these rules exist only because money still exists in the outside world.

People would have to leave everything (they own) at their arrival, and will of course get them back when they leave. It would be like a renaissance when they come in (and a death when they leave). They will be able to use anything inside but would not be able to take anything out.

These ressorts could also welcome children during school holidays, with an educational program (intellectual, sportive, behavioral, etc.). There would be no indoctrination, it would just allow children to enjoy such a life.
