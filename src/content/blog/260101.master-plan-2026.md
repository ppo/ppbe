## Objectives

**👉 True ONE objective: Initiate Unity Initiatives – Ignite the Unity Ground Zero movement**

To achieve this, I’ll focus on the following objectives:

1. Let the diamond shine… this coal has been under pressure for too long! And let the ugly duckling finally find his tribe… and soulmates.  
    _Focus: Work on identity unveiling, powered by Human Design._
2. Learn to truly commit to long-term end goals.  
    _Focus: Change my mindset from “this is not what I really want to do, it’s just a stepping stone I’m forced to do” to “this IS the journey, an integral part of the path toward my end goals”._
3. Find an environment where I can thrive.  
    _Focus: Find how to launch the first Unity Playground._
4. Join and get involved in the makers community.  
    _Focus: Make myself recognized as a valuable member in the makers community._


## Plan

**👉 True ONE commitment, to the ONE objective: Follow whichever path shows the strongest recognition**


### Commitment 1: Identity Unveiling

**Reprogram my subconscious to unveil my true self.**

1. Commit to applying the “Coronation“ methodology for a year – transmuting resistances as they surface.
2. Revise the work I did in April 2025 on Identity Shifting.
3. Adapt the “Coronation“ template and protocol for a Fixed Fate Projector.
4. Write my “Coronation Source Code”.
5. Constantly review and improve that document.

☝️ _I did it for 3 months in April 2025, but it was feeling offbeat, something was not right. Now, [knowing my Human Design chart](understanding-myself-through-human-design), it helps me understand why: It was intended more for Generators with a personal or transpersonal destiny – not for a Fixed Fate Projector. (“C’est peut-être un détail pour vous, mais pour moi, ça veut dire beaucoup.”)_

#### Resistance Transmutation

1. **Notice the Conditioning Pattern:**
    - “I should be doing more” ⇒ Generator comparison
    - “No one will do it right” ⇒ Control/trust wound
    - “I need to force this” ⇒ Desperation for recognition
    - “I’m not doing enough” ⇒ Worth = productivity
2. **Transmute It:**
    1. **Feel the sensation** – Where is it in my body?
    2. **Name it** – “This is conditioning, not truth”
    3. **Use In-Finite/AION** – Process it in the moment
    4. **Return to identity** – “I am the Unity Oracle, recognized and invited”
    5. **Trust the design** – “My value is in my seeing, not my doing”


### Commitment 2: Unity Playground #0

**Launch the first Unity Playground prototype.**

1. Commit to launching a first prototype of Unity Playground.
2. Define and share the Unity Playgrounds vision.
3. Build an audience interested in this vision.
4. Explore potential ways to launch this first prototype.


### Light-Commitment 3: Makerspace OS

**Build a makerspace management tool.**

1. Validate this business venture is the right starting point – _see below_.
2. Get involved in the makers community – via my main skills (analyst-developer).
3. Align with my and makers philosophy – DIY and open source software.
4. Create an opportunity for makers to unite towards a common goal.
5. Build the software I’ll need anyway for the Unity Playgrounds.

☝️ _This seems to be the best path (for me, now) to progress on the Unity Initiatives. I’ll start by investigating the current market of makerspace management solutions, without announcing “I’ll build this”. I’ll decide after that investigation whether it’s truly the best thing I should do now._


### Maker Experiences

#### Algarve Fab Farm

**Spend some time at [Algarve Fab Farm](https://www.fabfarm.org/)** ([Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/algarvefabfarm/))

1. Be a maker – work with my hands on concrete projects.
2. Honor my Human Design environment: kitchens (i.e. lab). Hopefully being energized by that environment.
3. Experience concretely a kind of mini Unity Playground.
4. Meet and exchange with someone who did something like I want to do.
5. Hopefully talk about my vision/ideas and have feedback from a real maker who did something similar.
6. Surely foster new ideas in my mind, and (in)validate some I already have.
7. Meet other makers among the volunteers – maybe “soulmates”.
8. Create networking opportunities – via owner or other volunteers.

#### Complementary

**Accumulate more maker experience** if:

1. The Algarve Fab Farm experience is positive.
2. It doesn’t distract me from my commitments.
3. It complements or generates positive energy for my commitments.

**Potential complementary experiences:**

1. Spend some time at other places like Algarve Fab Farm.
2. Find small personal maker projects to have fun.
3. Reproduce maker projects of other people to gain practical experience.

### Personal

**Unity Mastery Deepening:** (Line 1 Investigation)

- **Study** what fascinates me about Unity systems – go deep
- **Research** existing models – what’s working elsewhere?
- **Synthesize** – how does my seeing connect the dots differently?
- **Write when it flows** – capture insights for Eutopia book/framework


## Progress Compass

I’ve a special profile so I won’t bluntly apply conventional best practices – as it’s a recipe for failure… like it countlessly happened. Now that I’m aware of my Human Design, I’ll rather be inspired by best practices but adapt them to my profile.

Simple metrics are a very poor system that works only with simple things. What I’m trying to achieve has so many aspects and so many possible directions that it would involve too many metrics and require too complicated formulas. Moreover, I’ve a Splenic authority so the main criteria will be:  
**👉 Do I feel on track? Does it still feel right?**

Very precise commitments only make sense in very structured work environments. I’m navigating in the fog, on constantly changing roads, with unknowable constraints that are anyway out of my control.  
**👉 Extreme agility with iterative progress.**

Making a plan to reach a given destination passing by certain sub-destinations only works for fixed destinations. I’m moving towards multiple moving regions.  
**👉 Weekly status evaluations for course correction.**

### Success Indicators

- Splenic authority saying “Yes! 🫰👈” – _my automatic gesture for success/feeling right_.
- Recognition signals or even better, clear invitations.
- Feeling energized – _like the Duracell bunny_.

### Success Signals

Are these increasing?

- **Splenic trust** – following my authority without doubt.
- **Energy levels sustained** – not depleted, not burned out.
- **Unsolicited invitations** to share my perspective.
- **People referencing** my Unity Initiatives naturally.
- **Relationships deepening** – tribe recognizing me more clearly.
- **Wealth flowing** – from guidance, not from force.
- **Prototype evolving** – Unity Playground #0 becoming more real.
- **Transmission clarity** – vision easier to articulate.

**⚠️ _If these are declining:_** _I’m likely pushing (Generator energy) instead of projecting (recognition energy). ⇒ Rest. Recalibrate. Wait for the next invitation._

### Known Traps

- Being distracted by yet another shiny project when things get complicated or my energy is low.
- Trying to juggle with too many balls at the same time.
- Being absorbed by and lost in a side task/project – e.g. Algarve Fab Farm.
- Diving too deep into unnecessary investigation or perfectionism – e.g. [PyHD](learning-human-design-by-building-a-python-library).
- Working too much (like a Generator) ⇒ energy depletion ⇒ burn out.


## Planning

### January

1. Go to Algarve Fab Farm.
    - Participate in the projects.
    - Immerse myself in the “kitchen environment”.
    - Share experiences and lessons learned.
    - Stay as long as it brings value (me & them).
2. Unity Playground #0 – vision, analysis, presentation.
3. Side Task: Research other places like Algarve Fab Farm.


### February–December

- Agile weekly review & planning – cf. [Progress Compass](#progress-compass).
- With high-level planning every month and quarter.

### Potential 🔴 Items

#### Unity Playground #0

1. Start sharing the Unity Playgrounds vision.
    - Divide the vision into high-level parts that can be shared separately.
    - Incrementally improve each part.
    - Share vision chunks/teasers on socials.
2. Research public programs.
    - Identify best locations – in Europe.
    - Identify available public programs available for each location.
    - Analyze pros/cons of each location.
    - Rank locations according to opportunities and desirability.
3. Create a “Vision Plan”.
    - Storytelling selling the dream.
    - Benefits for our civilization.
    - Description of the first prototype.
    - Concrete plan to make it a success.
    - Requirements to build it.
4. Contact public programs.
    - Get up-to-date information.
    - Investigate the feasibility.
    - Discuss to better “feel it”.
    - Send applications.

#### Makerspace OS

1. Start “Makerspace Management Tools Analysis in Public”.
    - **What:**
        - “Let’s explore the current status of makerspace management tools”.
        - No announcement, not saying “I’ll build this”.
        - Market research, brainstorming, testing ideas, validate hypotheses.
        - Document existing tools, pain points, gaps.
    - **How:**
        - Publish regularly findings – daily to weekly according to quantity.
    - **Why:**
        - Low commitment (just researching).
        - High value (helping the ecosystem regardless).
        - Natural way to build recognition – without asking for anything.
        - Create opportunities for connections and feedback.
        - Validate my interest without pressure.
    - **Honoring my Human Design chart:**
        - Projector strategy:
            - Wait for invitation
            - Develop deep expertise
            - Self-expression as recognition opportunity
        - Line 1 (investigator)
        - Line 4 (networker)
2. Finalize the “Makerspace Management Tools Analysis”.
    - Publish a summary of my findings.
    - Maybe create an empty GitHub repo with requirements.
3. Decide whether to proceed with building Makerspace OS.  
    Splenic authority: **Is this the best path to the ONE objective?**
    - No → Find a replacement commitment.
    - Yes → Start working on it.
