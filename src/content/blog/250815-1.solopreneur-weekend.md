I've participated in 10+ [Startup Weekends](https://www.techstars.com/communities/startup-weekend) and loved the atmosphere, the energy, the accountability, the peer support. There's something magical about building alongside others under pressure.

But how can we replicate that energy when working alone? I've tried simulating it several times. It never worked 🫤


## The Problem

What made Startup Weekend special wasn't the audience – it was the **intimate peer energy**.

You can't simulate that alone. Your friends, family, and coworkers aren't necessarily into the same building mindset – especially not on weekends.

Sure, there's the "build in public" trend… but it feels impersonal and overwhelming. Constant tweeting, endless interactions, scattered attention across hundreds of followers you don't really know. It's broadcasting to the void rather than building with a tribe.

The real question is: Who's actually in the same "all-in mode" when you are, with the same dealine in sight?


## Solution: Solopreneur Weekend

Here's what I have in mind:

**Format:** Similar to Startup Weekend – pitch on Friday evening, launch on Sunday evening.

**Registration:** Create your project profile – introduce yourself, describe your project, share URLs, and record a 1-minute YouTube pitch.

**Your Tribe:** 10 Buddies – you're paired with 9 other builders who become your accountability partners for the weekend.

**The Wall:** A 3-by-3 grid showing real-time updates from your Buddies – with quick support and engagement from your tight-knit group.

**Hourly Check-Ins:** Brief video calls where everyone gets 30 seconds to share their current energy and focus.

**Micro Meetings:** Every 4 hours, a 15-minute video call to decompress, bond, and maintain momentum together.


## Why This Could Work

- **Intimate** – meaningful engagement with 10 people, not hundreds of strangers
- **Accountability** – you're in this together with a committed tribe  
- **Energetic** – regular touchpoints keep the momentum alive without overwhelming your focus
- **Focused** – small group dynamics create real relationships and genuine support


## Want to Test This Weekend?

I'm planning to build a project this weekend and would love some builders to **join me for a first "Solopreneur Weekend" experiment**.
