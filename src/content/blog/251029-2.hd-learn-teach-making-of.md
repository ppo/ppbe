<div class="remark">
    This explains the making of the article “<a href="human-design-learning-with-ai-in-public-by-teaching">Learning-with-AI-in-Public-by-Teaching Human Design</a>”.
</div>


## Methodology

The core idea is to maintain my authentic voice while leveraging AI for structure. I use [Claude](https://claude.ai/).

The process is:

- I provide a briefing explaining what I want to write.
- Claude provides a general structure for the entire article and key points to cover in each section. We discuss until I’m satisfied.
- We proceed section by section:
    - Claude asks targeted questions to cover the key points.
    - I don’t necessarily answer them directly, I just use them as a springboard to start writing.
    - I write just raw ideas as they flow in a draft document.
- I quickly review the full draft content.
- Claude analyzes it and provide feedback and recommendations. We discuss until I’m satisfied.
- Claude fixes and improves the form while keeping the voice intact.
- I review and do some final editing – and usually put back some pieces I really want to keep.
- Claude proposes some version for title, subtitle, abstract, keywords. And ideas/prompts for the main visual.

You can read the full details of this methodology in the section “Article Writing Protocol” of my [Human Design Learning/Teaching Pedagogy](https://ppolleunus.notion.site/HD-Learning-Teaching-Pedagogy-2884a4a4dcf58058954ddb3b23c8f14e).

Here’s how I applied it to the aforementioned article…


## Step 1: Briefing

I explained to Claude what I wanted to write about, and he asked clarifying questions to understand the scope and direction.

Here’s the initial prompt: _(within a Claude Project configured for this Learning-with-AI-in-Public-by-Teaching experiment; so he has more context, instructions, and files)_

> Let’s write a first blog article to mainly say: «I discovered my Human Design design. I was immediately hooked. So I started to watch a lot of videos to learn more… and I became even more hooked! So I decided to Learning-with-AI-in-Public-by-Teaching – a multi-facet experiment.»
> Then explaining what I’m planning to do from a high-level point of view. Linking to the pedagogy to learn more.  
> My last blog article is: https://pascal.polleunus.be/blog/understanding-myself-through-human-design

## Step 3: Section-by-Section Iteration

### Section 1: The Discovery Momentum

**Key Points from Step 2:**

- 🧞‍♂️ Discovered Human Design and your chart
- 🧞‍♂️ Initial fascination (“so interesting, I’m hooked!“)
- 🧞‍♂️ Watched videos to learn more
- 🧞‍♂️ Got even MORE hooked
- 🧞‍♂️ The turning point: understanding wasn’t enough

**🧞‍♂️ Interview Questions:**

1. **The initial discovery:** What was the exact moment or circumstance when you first encountered Human Design? What made you decide to look into your chart?
2. **The fascination:** When you first saw your chart or learned about your design, what specifically hooked you? Was it a particular insight, or just the overall system?
3. **Going deeper:** You mentioned watching “a lot of videos” – what drove you to keep watching? What were you looking for?
4. **The shift:** At what point did you realize that just understanding your own chart wasn’t enough? What was the feeling or thought that made you want to go deeper into the system itself?

**Plan Update:**

🤠 Moved from section 2 to 3:

- Splenic intuition saying “this is important“, “a good string to have on my bow”


### Section 2: The Realization

**Key Points from Step 2:**

- 🧞‍♂️ Understanding yourself vs. truly understanding the system
- 🧞‍♂️ The difference between consuming information and mastering it
- 🧞‍♂️ Your investigator nature demanding deeper knowledge
- 🧞‍♂️ Connection to Feynman quote: “If you can’t explain it simply…”
- 🤠 Human Design as potential tool for your future projects (Eutopia, Unity Ground Zero, Makers Paradise)
    - 🤠 As a beacon to attract aligned people
    - 🤠 As a deconditioning tool (first phase when people arrive)
    - 🤠 Fits your vision for education in Eutopia
- 🤠 Strategic recognition building (focusing on one thing first before introducing bigger mission)

**🧞‍♂️ Interview Questions:**

1. **Understanding yourself vs. the system:** At what point did you realize there’s a difference between “this explains ME” and “I want to understand HOW this works”? What triggered that shift?
2. **Your investigator kicks in:** You mentioned the Feynman quote “If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough yet” – when did this standard become important for your Human Design learning?
3. **The bigger mission intuition:** You said your splenic authority told you “this is important for your bigger mission” – can you describe that moment/feeling? How did you connect Human Design to Eutopia, Unity Ground Zero, Makers Paradise?
4. **Strategic recognition:** You mentioned that Projectors “must” focus on one thing to be recognized – when did you realize Human Design could be that “one thing” for you? Was this a calculated decision or another splenic hit?

**Plan Update:**

🤠 Moved from section 2 to 3:

- The difference between consuming information and mastering it
- Connection to Feynman quote: “If you can’t explain it simply…”


### Section 3: The Decision: Learning-with-AI-in-Public-by-Teaching

**Key Points from Step 2:**

- 🤠 “I’ve always learned in an atypical way” – this multi-facet approach fits how you naturally learn
- (🤠 Plan Update) 🧞‍♂️ The difference between consuming information and mastering it
- (🤠 Plan Update) 🧞‍♂️ Connection to Feynman quote: “If you can’t explain it simply…”
- 🧞‍♂️ Four simultaneous experiments merged into one approach
- 🧞‍♂️ Brief explanation of what each part means (very high-level)

**🧞‍♂️ Interview Questions:**

1. **Your learning style:** You said “I’ve always learned in an atypical way” – can you describe how you naturally learn? What makes traditional methods (books, courses) not work for you?
2. **The four experiments:** You’re running four experiments simultaneously:
    - Learning by Teaching (Feynman)
    - Learning with AI
    - Learning in Public
    - Pedagogy as Self-Reflection
    How did you realize these four things should be combined? Was it one decision or did they naturally merge?
3. **Why this approach fits:** How does this multi-faceted approach align with how you’ve always wanted to learn?


### Section 4: The Experiment: What This Looks Like

**Key Points from Step 2:**

- 🧞‍♂️ Creating educational content while learning
- 🧞‍♂️ Using AI as learning partner (not just research assistant)
- 🧞‍♂️ Learning in public (documenting the journey)

**🧞‍♂️ Interview Questions:**

1. **Creating educational content while learning:** What does this look like practically? Are you writing as you learn each concept? What format(s)?
2. **AI as learning partner:** How is working with AI different from just “using it for research”? What’s the actual collaboration like?
3. **Learning in public:** Where are you sharing this journey? What are you comfortable showing (confusion, mistakes, breakthroughs)?
4. **The outcome:** What tangible things will exist from this experiment? (blog posts, courses, tools, etc.)

**Plan Update:**

🤠 Undo: Moved back from section 6 to 4:

- 🧞‍♂️ Knowledge graph approach (structured, modular learning)


### Section 5: The Why: Personal Alignment

**Key Points from Step 2:**

- 🧞‍♂️ Deep understanding through teaching (Feynman technique)
- 🧞‍♂️ Building recognition as educator (Projector preparing for invitations)
- 🧞‍♂️ Supporting self-esteem and energy alignment
- 🧞‍♂️ Attracting collaborators
- 🧞‍♂️ Revenue potential (ethical monetization)

**🧞‍♂️ Interview Questions:**

1. **Deep understanding through teaching:** Why is the Feynman Technique specifically important to you? (You touched on this in Section 3, but here we can go deeper into the personal why)
2. **Building recognition / Preparing for invitations:** What does “being recognized as an Human Design educator” actually mean to you? What would that look like?
3. **Self-esteem and energy alignment:** How does this experiment support your self-esteem? And what do you mean by “energy alignment”?
4. **Attracting collaborators:** Who are you hoping to attract? What kind of collaborations do you envision?
5. **Revenue potential:** How do you think about monetizing this? What feels ethical vs. what feels icky?

**Side Note:**  
I’ve been working for too long (as a Projector) – 4-5 hours straight. What I wrote was a lot more confused and painful to do. So I’ll stop for today and continue tomorrow – honoring my energy type as part of this experiment.

- 🧞‍♂️ Cross of Crisis:
    - 🧞‍♂️ Using unique perspective to influence
    - 🤠 Human Design aligns with bigger life mission
    - 🤠 Building foundation now for the larger vision later

**🧞‍♂️ Interview Questions:**

1. **Investigator (1):** How does this deep research approach honor your line 1?
2. **Opportunist (4):** How is teaching Human Design helping you build recognition and network?
3. **Projector nature:** How is this whole experiment an example of “preparing for invitations” vs. giving unsolicited advice?
4. **Splenic Authority:** What was the splenic “yes” that started this? How are you trusting in-the-moment knowing?
5. **Cross of Crisis:** How does this Human Design work connect to your bigger life mission? How is it building foundation for the transformation work you’re called to do?


## Step 4: Finalization

After completing all 8 sections over two writing sessions, I had a complete first draft.

<div class="remark">
    <strong>Projector energy depletion:</strong><br>
    I pushed a bit too far on the first sessions, forcing through to finish… and the effects were noticeable: no real flow of ideas, confusion, tangled sentences, more typos… and mind ramblings!
</div>

**My feedback to Claude:**  
_“Here’s the whole article. What do you think? Shall we proceed with making this… readable? 😂”_

**Claude’s assessment:**

- Overall: authentic voice strong throughout, butterfly metaphor works well, structure flows logically
- What needs work: Section 5 shows energy depletion, some typos/grammar throughout, transitions could be smoother
- Recommendation: holistic polish pass – fix typos, tighten repetition, smooth transitions, resolve brackets, keep voice intact

I agreed and asked Claude to proceed.

**The polish:**  
Claude created an artifact with the polished version. I reviewed it against my first draft, putting back specific phrasings I wanted to keep – knowingly imperfect but to convey a certain “underlying message“, like I would in real-life.

**Final touches:**  
I asked Claude to propose some version for title, subtitle, abstract, keywords. Aswell as ideas/prompts for the main visual.  
I made my own version of these – usually combining some bits from here and there.

**Time investment:**

- Day 1: ~4-5 hours (sections 1-5, stopped due to energy depletion)
- Day 2: ~2 hours (sections 6-8, finalization)
- Total: ~6-7 hours (including methodology development)

This was the first time, had a huge amount of elements to include and it included developing the “Article Writing Protocol” itself, so future articles should be faster.
