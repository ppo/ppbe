## Introduction

### What Is the Makers Paradise?

A kind of mall or village **for all types of makers**. The ultimate coworking space bringing in one place **all types of shared spaces to live, work, meet, socialize, collaborate, exchange ideas, and share knowledge**.


### What Is a Maker?

A maker is someone who engages in the hands-on process of creating, modifying, or combining components to produce something new, whether physical or digital. Makers are characterized by their DIY mindset, willingness to experiment, and often participate in sharing knowledge and collaborating within maker communities.


## The Vision

Provide a centralized place to **allow makers to create whatever comes to their mind**, alone or with other makers, working on a single or multiple domains.

A place having **ultra-modern facilities** (on all aspects such as building, infrastructure, design, equipment) and vibrating at a **high level of consciousness** (cf. Love, Joy, oneness, mindfulness, respectâ€¦ and therefore environment friendliness, sustainability, social inclusionâ€¦).

A place where workshops are **fully equipped with the best and latest tools and machines**. Where the most common materials are available right where and when you need them. These workshops are interconnected and easily accessible from each other. There are also quieter spaces for office work and meetings.

A place where everything is designed and organized to **encourage socialization and collaboration, between coworkers but also with visitors**. The cafÃ© welcomes visitors coming simply by curiosity or to meet like-minded people. Conferences, meetups, training courses and other events are regularly organized to share knowledge and learn, or just to have fun.

A place that thrives on a powerful truth: **Unity Makes Strength** â€“ full of people who understand that in the spirit of **Ubuntu**, true innovation emerges when diverse talents come together without ego or competition. We're not just sharing space and tools, we're creating an environment where everyone's growth lifts the entire community. This mindset naturally attracts people who see beyond traditional constraints, who understand that extraordinary achievements become possible when we support each other's dreams. A place where people **experience Joy while doing things we truly Love** - because when passion drives creation, excellence follows naturally.

A place that is a **kinder playground for adults**, for people who are **"un poco loco in their head"**. Its philosophy promotes curiosity, creativity, newness, innovation, and making things differently. It encourages you to not take things too seriously, to approach things with playfulness and humorâ€¦ even with some craziness. Boring is proscribed, forbid as harmful! *(That does mean without being serious, responsible and respectful.)*

A place where typical members are **multipotential/interdisciplinary people overflowing with imagination**. They are passionate and love excellence â€“ doing things the way they must be done, striving for perfection. They share the same desire to brainstorm, design, prototype, and build. They are keen to collaborate, help, teach and learn. They work on interesting unusual projects that shake the status quo. Interesting on a technical, scientific, intellectual, or passionate level. With "unusual" meaning innovative, offbeat, unrealistic, or even crazy or unnecessary.

A place that is **a living lab made by makers, for makers** valuing openness and sharing. Most systems, furnitures and machines are made by our members; as collaborative projects for the space or as part of their business. In the former case, everything is released publicly and licensed as Open Source/Creative Commons.

Being a paradise, it's a place you don't want to leave! People will more often than not spend the whole week, weekend included, day and night, without leaving the place. To be adapted to that, maybe even to promote that, the place has **all the necessary amenities to live there and everything is accessible 24/7**. When you're not working in your workshop, lab or office, plating a seed in our farm or in someone's head, you can drink and eat at the cafÃ©, chill in the relax area, exercise in the gym, take a shower, and sleep in the dorm or in one of our tiny houses.

ðŸ¤” Well, "place" is not the best word to describe this idea. "Village" would probably be a better term.

Makers Paradise is actually **a network of such places all around the world**. Members have access to the global networkâ€¦ perfect for nomads! As money is still part of this reality, finances are shared worldwide, allowing to have Makers Paradises in all locations where it makes sense, even in those that will never be financially profitable. This is the wayâ€¦ it must be done!


## Genesis

My mind is often in brainstorming mode. Whenever I notice a problem or face something I don't like, I immediately switch into a "reverse engineering and problem solving" mode. I love to understand how things work, to invent or improve and design things. I also like to share knowledge; as I like to learn from others and as Richard Feynman said: "to master something, teach it."

Usually, everything happens only in my head due to lack of resources (materials, equipment, space). I usually lack motivation because most of the time I don't want to make a business out of these ideas, and/or it has no sense to make it only for me, and/or I don't want to work alone on them.

Also because I don't find a place where I would really like to work, a place I could call home. I would love to live in a lab where I could concretize my ideas 24/7, whenever I want and for as long as I want. And not being stuck because I don't have the equipment or space required for the job, and to some extent also the material.


## Spaces & Activities

What do I mean by "all types makers"? Let's list the main categories of makers:

- **Physical Makers:**
    - **Craftspeople:** Work with traditional materials like wood, metal, leather, or textiles
    - **Artisanal:** Create handmade products like soaps, foods, beverages, or cosmetics
    - **Mechanical:** Build machines, automata, or mechanical systems
    - **Hardware/Electronics:** Create circuits, robotics, IoT devices, and electronic projects
    - **Digital Fabrication:** Design and produce objects using modern manufacturing tools
- **Digital Makers:**
    - **Software Developers:** Create applications, tools, games, and digital solutions
    - **Digital Artists:** Create digital artwork, animations, or 3D models
    - **Content Creators:** Produce digital content like videos, podcasts, or interactive media

So, people do activities such as design, research & development/discovery, craftsmanship, manufacturing, repairing, recycling. As well as socializing, brainstorming, learning and teaching. These may be digital or involving everything related to the work of matter: wood, metal, ceramic, textileâ€¦

Some activities require isolated specialized spaces like kitchen, farm (indoor & outdoor), digital fabrication (3D printing, CNC), scientific lab (chemistry, biology, physics), auto mechanics (garage, paint booth), media studio (audio, video, and music production, 3D modeling, virtual and augmented reality), art studio (painting, ceramic, textile), office (open space and private rooms). Also meeting, conference, and training rooms.

It includes also social spaces like relax areas (games, nap, meditation, yoga), nature (garden, park, pool), gym, accommodation (dorm and private rooms), and commercial spaces like cafÃ©, restaurant, shops (materials, components, tools, equipmentâ€¦).


## A First Prototype

In the context of this [my Master Plan 2025](https://pascal.polleunus.be/master-plan-2025), we'll narrow this down to the strict minimum allowing us to comfortably work on our six projects; especially our flagship project, the Collaborative Van Build. *(See the master plan for details.)*

Where in the world should we create that first prototype? A place for makers of all domains, aiming aiming to initiate a transition to a new age. Isn't Florence, Italy an obvious choice? Maybe even the only one!

Florence, the birthplace of the Renaissance â€“ the transition from Middle Ages to modernity. A place where great social change took place in most fields and disciplines. A place where art and engineering flew as one â€“ perhaps the first living lab. Florence was probably the first Makers Paradise! The place one of history's greatest makers called home, a place still infused by the spirit of Leonardo da Vinci.

Florence, it must be!


## Looking Forward

While the prototype focuses on the essentials needed for the Collaborative Van Build project, it's designed as a seed that can grow into something greater. Every decision we make, from layout to equipment selection, considers both immediate needs and future potential. We're not just building a workshop - we're laying the foundation for a concept that could transform how makers collaborate worldwide.

The long-term vision remains clear: a global network of Makers Paradises, each unique to its location but connected by shared principles and purpose. But for now, we're focused on proving the concept in Florence, demonstrating that when skilled people unite around a compelling goal, with access to necessary resources and freedom to work as they see fit, they can achieve extraordinary results.

This is Makers Paradise - where unity makes strength, where passion meets purpose, and where the future of collaborative creation is being built, one project at a time.


## One More Thing

### All-in-Oneâ€¦

**All:** Our guiding vision: all types of spaces, welcoming all types of makers, embracing all domains of creation.

**In:** Inclusive by nature, where diversity enriches the whole. *(genuine inclusion, not woke)*

**One:** United by our core beliefs: Unity Makes Strength and Ubuntu ("I am because we are").

**All-in-One** for Love to flow in any way, shape or form your Joy so desires.
