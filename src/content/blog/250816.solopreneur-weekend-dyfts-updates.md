## Friday

- 15:00 Took 2 hours to publish the [Solopreneur Weekend article](solopreneur-weekend)
- 17:00 Took 3 hours to publish the [pitch article](shipping-my-first-micro-saas-in-54-hours)! _(clarifying the objectives and idea, endless unnecessary fine-tuning, perfecting the visual generated by ChatGPT, fixing deployment error 🤬)_
- 20:00 Took 3 hours to cook and eat, and started to watch a podcast while eating… that I "had to" finish 🙄
- 23:00 went to bed but couldn't sleep until 2am 🫤


## Saturday

- 06:00 Woke up
- 06:20 At my desk… with the coffee pot ready 💪
- 06:20 Quick 20-minute meditation… extending to 1.5 hours 🤷‍♂️
- 08:00 "Had to" share my insights on Facebook (30 minutes) 🙄
    > The meditation insights contain a potential pivot for "Do You Feel The Same?"… doesn't change the complexity but I'm postponing any change to tomorrow… and will start by creating a base app, fully working, integrated with third-parties, but without any feature or copywriting.
- 08:30 Writing this while 💩 (15 minutes… losing way too much time trying to communicate clearly what I've in mind 🫤)
- 09:00 Shower… then back to work… well, start to work!
- So productivity score so far? Very low, not proud 😞 No Solopreneur Weekend energy 🪫
- 09:15 Back to desk
- 09:35 Publishing this
