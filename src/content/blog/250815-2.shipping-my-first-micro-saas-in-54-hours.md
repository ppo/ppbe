title: Shipping My First MicroSaaS in 54 Hours
subtitle: Do You Feel The Same?
abstract: "Let’s break free from the “shiny object syndrome” and actually ship something! This weekend, I’m building my first MicroSaaS – not for success nor to get rich, but to master the art of finishing… and hopefully find the tech stack and methodologies that are right for me."

## The Real Objective

I’ve had enough of jumping between projects… before even really starting any. This weekend isn’t about building the next unicorn – it’s about **mastering the fundamentals of shipping**… ideally fast.

**My Goals:**
1. **Ship fast and lean** – focus on MVP essence, not perfection
2. **Test a tech stack** – productive, not nerdy
3. **Use AI-assisted coding** – without micro-management
4. **Learn the full cycle** – code, launch, promote, sell, improve
5. **Actually finish something** – instead of chasing the next shiny idea


## The Simplest Project

During my meditation, I asked for the simplest possible MicroSaaS project… and a 15+ years old idea came back in my mind.

**The Problem:** We’ve all been there. Remember that girl you liked in the elementary playground? So you asked your friend to ask her friend whether she wants to be your girlfriend. And later, you’re attracted to a woman on your work place but only want something casual… and you’re afraid to ruins the relationship.

**The Solution:** An app for sending an “respectful but straight to the point” message to a specific person. No profiles, no swiping, just genuine communication. Like a “message in a bottle” reaching only those who are open to that kind of proposals.

**Why It’s Perfect for Learning:**
- **Dead simple concept** – no complex algorithms
- **Finite scope** – no endless features
- **Clear monetization** – pay per message (acting as spam filter)
- **Personal need** – I actually want to use this 😉

**Plot Twist:** A name came immediately to my mind: “Do You Feel The Same?” – which perfectly expresses the essence of this app. So first things first, is the domain available? No. What is [that site](https://doyoufeelthesame.com/)? No way, it’s the exact same base idea!… with very poor execution.


## The Tech Stack

I recently discovered [Next.js SaaS Starter](https://github.com/nextjs/saas-starter) which seems perfect:

> This is a starter template for building a SaaS application using Next.js with support for authentication, Stripe integration for payments, and a dashboard for logged-in users. Using Postgres and shadcn/ui.

Adding to this [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for the hosting and [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) for transactional emails.

For the coding, probably [Cursor](https://cursor.com/) which will be easier to vibe code with [Claude](https://claude.ai/). _I’m used to VS Code and already worked a bit with Cursor._

💪 First shiny object traps avoided! Not falling for learning [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) nor trying to switch to [Zed](https://zed.dev/).


## The Weekend Challenge

It’s Friday… so as usual in these moments, I remind myself the [Startup Weekends](https://www.techstars.com/communities/startup-weekend). I often tried to recreate the energy boost of these events by myself but it never worked! But now I had a new idea… OK, I fell a bit for that siny object… but consciously and not for long 😉

You can discover that here: [Solopreneur Weekend](/blog/solopreneur-weekend) – the idea: keeping the same working principles as Startup Weekend, simulating small teams, and planning momentum boosters.

It's too late to launch that for this weekend but I can still include some small experiments.


### The Plan

**Friday Evening:**
- This pitch
- Create third-party services accounts
- Define the core working principles

**Saturday:**
- Define the core message, the unique value proposition
- Publish a first launch page
- Create the Next.js SaaS Starter project

**Sunday:**
- Implement and test integrations (database, email, payment…)
- Prepare the presentation and product launch
- Launch campaign on Product Hunt


### Success Metrics

- Tech stack validated _(or lessons learned)_
- Full launch cycle completed
- No shiny object chasing _for 54 hours straight_


## Let’s Go!

It’s actually already started… but this is not the priority so no time to lose on this!

I’ll keep in mind to document this with `#SolopreneurWeekend` for the experiment.

**Let’s see if I can actually finish something for real! 🚀**
