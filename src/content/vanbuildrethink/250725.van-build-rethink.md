## Some Background

When I was a kid, my father used to jokingly say: "Yes, yes, mister the engineer." Well, was he joking?

I've always been the curious type ‚Äì asking too many questions, analyzing and reverse-engineering everything to understand how it actually works. With a creative mind in the mix ‚Äì constantly brainstorming ways to improve, combine, or invent things. Naturally, this led to a DIY approach to life: customizing and creating things to fit my exact needs. No wonder I'm such a huge MacGyver fan üòâ

At university, I found myself torn between industrial engineering, computer science, and architecture‚Ä¶ but would have loved industrial design ‚Äì if only I'd known it existed back then.


## Some Context

I've been thinking about vanlife for years and have watched way too many conversion videos‚Ä¶ well, not exactly _watching_, more like analyzing every detail, questioning every choice‚Ä¶ and taking notes. Lots of notes. Going in all directions, chaotically! Are cluttered notes a sign of a cluttered mind? ü§Ø

Now I'm finally ready for adventure! I sold my apartment and a few months later bought a 2020 VW Caddy ‚Äì the smallest van I can actually fit in. Why? Because I had this brilliant idea: minimal space equals maximum constraints, which means I'll have to think harder and be more creative. That sounds like fun, right? üòÇ

So here I am: minimalist and homeless by choice, living in an unconverted mini-van (with all my belongings crammed inside üôÑ), with a head full of crazy incompatible ideas and nowhere to work on them properly. Time to embrace the chaos and do something with it‚Ä¶ so let the fun begin! üòÅ


## What Is Van Build Rethink?

**Van Build Rethink** is about mastering the fundamentals of van building through deep understanding rather than surface-level copying.

We start by diving deep into the science behind every aspect ‚Äì the physics of insulation, the engineering of electrical systems, the design thinking behind crafting tailor-made solutions with optimal user experience. We learn the first principles that govern how things actually work.

Then we float back to the surface applying critical thinking to current practices in the vanlife community. Not to judge and condemn, but to understand and _objectively criticize_ (meaning: _to consider the merits and demerits and form an opinion accordingly_).

Finally, we let our creative minds _drive_ away to new territories. Armed with solid fundamentals and freed from the _copycat box_, we can freely explore how to customize our homes on wheels in ways that truly fit our individual needs.

This isn't just about building vans ‚Äì it's about _Think Different_ like Apple meant it: encouraging innovation, creativity, and a non-conformist approach to problem-solving.

**It's about creating a community where knowledge flows freely, where assumptions are questioned constructively, and where innovation happens through collaboration.**

Unity Makes Strength! Let's bring together our collective intelligence and see what we can achieve in unity. ü§ùüß†üí™


## Why Am I Doing This?

**Personal Growth:** I'm transitioning from the digital world to physical making, learning to do more with less. This project lets me combine my analytical nature with hands-on creation while exploring territories I've always been drawn to but never fully entered.

**Natural Expression:** This is simply who I am. I can't help but question, analyze, and reinvent things. Rather than fighting this tendency, I'm embracing it fully and letting my true self guide the process. It's liberating to stop pretending to be someone else.

**Knowledge Sharing:** Learning and teaching are two sides of the same coin. By documenting my journey of understanding, I'm applying the Feynman Technique: "explaining concepts to others can significantly enhance one's own understanding" and "If you can't explain it simply, you don't truly understand it."

**Community Building:** Unity Makes Strength. I believe in the power of collective intelligence and collaborative problem-solving. By bringing together curious minds who aren't afraid to challenge assumptions, we can achieve wonders‚Ä¶ anything.

**Inspiring Change:** I want to show people there's another way to approach DIY projects ‚Äì through understanding rather than imitation, through first principles rather than blind following. Not because other approaches are wrong, but because this approach might unlock possibilities we haven't considered yet.


## How Will This Work?

**Agile Approach:** Pick one component, system or topic, create the smallest meaningful exploration, then iterate and improve. No waiting for perfection ‚Äì document the messy middle, share the learning process, and build understanding incrementally.

**Deep Dive Methodology:**

1. **Start with fundamentals:** First principles analysis. What's the science involved? What do we absolutely know is true?
2. **Research existing approaches:** What are others doing?
3. **Understand use cases:** How do people actually use their vans and what are their real needs?
4. **Apply critical thinking:** Why do people approach it this way? What assumptions are being made?
5. **Explore alternatives:** What if we tried a completely different approach?
6. **Test and document:** Real-world experimentation with different approaches and materials ‚Äì honest results, failures included.

**Learn in Public:** Share the journey as it happens. Not polished tutorials, but raw exploration. The goal is to show the thinking process, not just the final answers.

**Community Collaboration:** This isn't a solo journey. Bring in experts, welcome challenges to my thinking, and create space for others to share their own first-principles explorations.

**Practical Thread:** Use my VW Caddy as laboratory for R&D, with real conversion decisions as the framework for exploration. Each topic emerges from actual needs, keeping theory grounded in practice.


## My Hope for This Project

My hope? To create a growing library of deep-dive explorations that help anyone approach van building ‚Äì or any DIY project ‚Äì with true understanding rather than surface-level copying.

But more than that, I hope to inspire a shift in how we think about making things. To show that questioning assumptions isn't about being difficult ‚Äì it's about unlocking possibilities we didn't know existed.
