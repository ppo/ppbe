Are you still with me after this nice little diagram? üòÅ OK, let's go‚Ä¶

This article outlines the process of converting a van into a camper, broken down into three sequential phases: *Definition*, *Planning*, and *Execution*. It provides first a high-level view, followed by detailed explanations of each phase and its components.

The *Definition* phase is particularly crucial as it contains four parallel tracks that work together iteratively. Each track is detailed in its own section to guide you through this critical foundation phase.


## High-Level View

The build process is organized into three distinct phases, each with its own rhythm and purpose. *Definition* helps you discovering what you truly want to achieve, *Planning* creates your roadmap, and *Execution* brings your vision to life.


### Phase 1: Definition

A creative process where you explore possibilities before narrowing down to final decisions.

- Work through parallel tracks that inform each other
- Move freely between stages as you discover and refine
- Continue until your vision is fully specified


### Phase 2: Planning

A linear process to create your clear roadmap.

- Transform your specifications into an actionable plan
- Build each element upon the previous
- Produce clear, concrete deliverables


### Phase 3: Execution

A step-by-step building process‚Ä¶ you know, like IKEA does so well.

- Follow your plan layer by layer
- Pre-build components in parallel
- Apply an iterative development cycle at each step

---

Now, let's explore each phase in more detail:


## Phase 1: Definition

The *Definition* phase is your exploration and discovery journey. Like Sherlock Holmes, you'll gather clues about what you want, research possibilities, test ideas, and document your findings. You'll move back and forth between these activities until you have a clear picture of what you'll build.


### Track 1: Requirements Discovery

- Define who will use the van and how they live
- List daily activities and needed equipment
- Map out required spaces and systems
- Specify storage needs
- Describe design and style preferences


### Track 2: Research & Exploration

- Study other van builds for inspiration
- Generate ideas and possible solutions
- Test concepts through sketches and models
- Find innovative approaches to challenges


### Track 3: Analysis & Validation

- Check if ideas match your lifestyle needs
- Analyze technical requirements
- Verify feasibility within your constraints
- Choose your vehicle and components
- Validate your final selections


### Track 4: Specifications

- Document your design decisions
- Create detailed technical drawings
- Write step-by-step build procedures
- List required resources and materials


## Phase 2: Planning

In *Planning*, you turn your specifications into a clear roadmap. Like preparing for a long journey, you'll map out your route, gather your resources, anticipate challenges, and establish checkpoints.


### Timeline Development

- Set major project milestones
- Map task dependencies and sequence
- Optimize your schedule flow
- Add buffer for unexpected challenges


### Resource Planning

- Set up your workspace
- Gather necessary tools
- Get materials and components
- Identify skills to learn or improve


### Risk Assessment

- Identify critical path tasks
- Prepare backup plans
- Consider weather impact
- Plan alternative approaches


### Quality Control

- Define inspection checkpoints
- Establish testing methods
- Set documentation standards
- Create safety protocols


## Phase 3: Execution

The *Execution* phase is just like assembling IKEA furniture‚Ä¶ remember when you started without reading the instructions first? Yeah, you don't want that here, right? So you'll follow a step-by-step process ‚Äì building some parts on your workbench while assembling others directly in your van. For each piece, you'll follow the same development cycle to ensure quality.


### Track 1: Component Assembly

- Plan assembly sequence
- Build and test on workbench
- Install in vehicle
- Connect with other systems


### Track 2: Layer Progression

*Note: This stage contains the core building blocks of your van conversion. Each layer has its own complexities and interdependencies that will be detailed in dedicated articles.*

- Vehicle preparation
- Insulation
- Utilities infrastructure (ex: cabling, plumbing)
- Framework (structural elements)
- System components (ex: water, electrical)
- Functional elements (ex: cabinets, bed)
- Interior finishing


### Development Cycle

This cycle is applied to each component and layer.

1. **Preparation**
    - Review plans and specifications
    - Set up workspace and tools
    - Stage materials and components
    - Do final pre-build checks
2. **Build**
    - Follow build sequence
    - Install elements
    - Connect systems
    - Add finishing details
3. **Quality Assurance**
    - Test functions
    - Check connections
    - Verify specifications
    - Inspect safety
4. **Documentation**
    - Record build steps
    - Take progress footage
    - Note challenges and solutions
    - Update build documentation
5. **Retrospective**
    - Review success and challenges
    - Identify improvements
    - Update future plans and procedures

Finally, let's dive deep into each of the four parallel tracks of the *Definition* phase:


## Phase 1: Track 1: Requirements Discovery

*Requirements Discovery* builds your foundation. Like writing a story, you start by understanding your characters (users), their adventures (activities), and the tools they need (gear and systems).

- **Who**
    - Define user profiles
    - Describe characteristics: physical, emotional, behavioral‚Ä¶
    - Document habits and preferences
    - Detail specific needs

    - Define travel patterns
    - Consider climate and terrain
- **Activities**
    - Map daily routines
    - List specific activity needs
- **Belongings**
    - Inventory clothes and activity equipment
    - Inventory gear and electronics
    - Define storage requirements (especially special needs)
- **Zones**
    - *<u>Note:</u> I use common terminology here‚Ä¶ but I know, we're not building a castle! This is to help you think about conceptual areas. Then, like the makers of Swiss army knives, you'll have to use your creativity to make everything fit in a shoe box!*  
      Here are the common areas to consider:
