## A Generator World

I was born in Belgium. Our national motto – _Unity Makes Strength_ – always resonated deeply with me. So obvious. So simple. So pure.

Yet, are we actually applying this principle in modern society? No.

Why? I suspect it’s because of the hustle culture. The constant doing leaves no space for stepping back, for seeing the bigger picture, for asking: “Is this where we want to go?”

> According to Human Design, 70% of the population are Generators – people with consistent, sustainable energy for work. They’re the builders, the doers, the ones who can keep going.

Modern society was built by Generators, for Generators. The hustle culture that dominates our world emerged from their energy – do, do, do… faster, more, always moving. _Toujours la tête dans le guidon_ (“always head down on the handlebars” – like cycling hard without looking up to see where you’re going).

> According to Human Design, 9% of the population are Manifestors – the initiators who can start things, impact others, and set movements in motion without waiting for permission.

In this Generator-built world, Manifestors thrive. Their initiating aura complements Generator energy perfectly — Manifestors spark the fire, Generators keep it burning. Together, they built the modern world.

But that’s not me…


## The Projector’s Dilemma

> According to Human Design, 20% of the population are Projectors – people designed to understand systems, guide energy, and see what others miss. They don’t have sustainable work energy; their gift is wisdom, not stamina.

As a Projector, I don’t have the consistent energy of Generators to build everything myself. Nor do I have the Manifestor’s aura to make things happen and attract people.

My gift is in seeing possibilities. I’ve had many visions throughout my life, leading to imagining many projects… but concretely, I started none… well, I started all of them but quickly stopped – every time.

[Understanding my Human Design chart](understanding-myself-through-human-design) helped me see why:

- Projectors don’t have building energy or manifesting aura
- My “Cross of Crisis” – producing events that foster visions
- My “Fixed Fate” destiny – I’m here as a bridge between paradigms; not to live a flexible, exploratory life
- My only “Channel of Surrender” – the ability to release ego for the greater good, transmitting what serves the collective
- I’m here to see, transmit, and guide – not to do it all, especially not alone


## Seeing from the Mountaintop

What if we pause to take a step back, climb to the top of the mountain, and look into the distance? What would we see?

That’s what Projectors do naturally. That’s what I did… and according to me – spoiler alert – we’re heading straight for a wall!

So I asked myself: “If we wanted to start all over from scratch, given the current state of our knowledge and technologies, what would an intelligent civilization do?” That questioning led to “my” Eutopia vision – more on that another time.

Astronauts describe the “Overview Effect”. Seeing Earth from space transforms perspective. No borders visible. Just one ship floating in darkness, held together by a thin, fragile protective atmosphere. We’re all on this ship together.

The solution to all the major problems we currently have in the world is quite simple… We just need to understand who we are as a species. Humans are not the strongest, fastest, nor most intelligent. Humans are an ultrasocial, highly collaborative species that relies on cooperation to survive, thrive, and solve complex problems.

We know that… yet are we using that to our advantage? No! We know yet don’t apply – let’s face it, we’re stupid! 🤷‍♂️ OK, more positive – it’s because we have always _la tête dans le guidon._

What if we did something completely insane?… Like putting aside everything that divides us and actually applying Unity Makes Strength – all together. Crazy, right? 🙄

## Insights

Is the answer hiding in ancient wisdom?

The Ubuntu philosophy says: “I am because we are.” Indigenous gift economies operate from relationship-as-primary, not transaction-as-primary — their “accounting” held in webs of mutual care, not ledgers.

What if we already live in a world of potential abundance — but can’t see it because we’re too busy competing?

Consider this: we’re all unique pieces that fit perfectly in a divine puzzle… incomplete until each finds their right place.

Imagine everybody doing everything they can to help you — skilled people covering your weaknesses so you can focus on your strengths. How would your life be? How would your projects progress?
And if you did the same for others? Could it be that the more you give, the more you receive?

Now consider money. Can you imagine the humongous overhead burden it imposes just to function together? If our economy were a machine, how energy efficient would it be? Can you imagine all the time and resources that would not be lost if we didn’t need money to function together?

“An eye for an eye.” Is it wisdom or foolishness? Isn’t that what money fundamentally is – assigning value to everything and keeping meticulous score between individuals?

What if we didn’t need the money? 🤔 _More on that another time…_

Big questions. I’ve been sitting on them for decades, unable to act. Why? Because I kept trying to do it the Generator way. Anyway, enough philosophy… 😉


## A Different Approach

I’ve had many ideas throughout my life but I don’t have the aura to ignite projects, nor the consistent energy to implement everything myself. So I’ve to _think different!_

Maybe these visions are divine guidance, cosmic downloads, whatever you want to call them… not meant for me but for humanity. What has been in the way for all my life was my ego – conditioned by the hustle culture worshiping money. I had everything in front of my eyes yet not seeing it – Unity Makes Strength, Open Source, Ubuntu. The height of irony for a Projector who is a seer! 🙄 I knew yet didn’t apply – let’s face it, I was stupid! 🤷‍♂️

The solution? Releasing these visions… set them free – FLOSS-like, free as in speech and beer.

It’s time for me to apply, to embody what I’m preaching for 20+ years. In 2 words: unity and moneyless – free speech and free beer.

Creating vision documents, raw braindumps, incomplete analyses, empty GitHub repositories. Simply planting seeds and watering them, leaving them free, trusting the process… to see what grows.

These are invitations for cocreation from the very first step. I see these as “excuses” to promote Unity Makes Strength and foster what I call “Unity Collaboration” – applying unity principles in practice.

Most projects start with something concrete first – people joining for what exists. This approach is unusual. Probably awkward. These projects start with the vision – people joining for what could be.

**This framework is itself a work in progress** – [see current version below](#starting-together).  
**Feedback welcome. Questions encouraged.**

This is the first real test for what is needed for Eutopia: What if we start together from scratch? It’s the first stepping stone toward how Eutopia might actually work – not through individual heroics, but through recognizing our different energies and combining them smartly.

**Let’s see what emerges when we start together… as sovereign beings – “I’ve skills, I take in charge what I’m good at, waiting for no one but me”.**

## Starting Together

This is a formalized vision – an idea that flew through my mind, now planted here as a seed to see what grows.

**Think Different**

Most projects start with a prototype or something concrete, then seek or attract contributors. This project begins with just a vision and invites cocreation from the very first step. I know, it’s unusual. Probably awkward. It’s different.

**Unity Makes Strength**

To build, we use tools. Not one, a toolbox. We need the right one for the job, used at the right time. It’s the same with people. We all have different and complementary skills. Success happens when we combine them smartly.

**Project Phases**

Projects need different energies at different phases:

1. **Vision** – understanding systems, seeing possibilities
2. **Ignition** – communicating vision, rallying momentum
3. **Implementation** – building concrete stuff, sustained execution

**People Energies**

Human Design identifies these energy types: _(% of population)_

1. **Vision** – Projectors, 20% (Gary Vaynerchuk)
2. **Ignition** – Manifestors, 9% (Elon Musk)
3. **Implementation** – Generators, 70% (Linus Torvalds)

**What’s Needed Here**

Releasing this vision is my contribution – as Projector. This project needs ignition and implementation, running in parallel. Other visionaries are welcome too.

Down the road, I’ll likely be most active as “guardian of the vision” – someone at the top of the hill seeing into the distance. Concretely: brainstorming, ideas, constructive criticism (usually brutally honest).

**Hearing the Call?**

- **Curious?** Ask questions
- **Interested?** Start a discussion
- **Visionary?** Share your thoughts
- **Motivated?** Join forces

This is an invitation to cocreate from the ground up. Let’s see what emerges when we start together – from scratch.
