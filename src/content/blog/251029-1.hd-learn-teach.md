## The Discovery Momentum

It all started on June 17th, 2025, when my friend [Jean](https://design-humain-evolution.org/) offered to analyze [my Human Design chart](understanding-myself-through-human-design).

I’d heard of Human Design for at least a year and had two opportunities to get my chart analyzed. I was somewhat interested, mainly curious – but neither opportunity materialized, and I didn’t push.

As Jean explained my BodyGraph reading, I became more and more intrigued by the “coincidences” – it was remarkably accurate with insights I’d gained from decades of self-analysis. Hearing about Strategy, particularly mine – “wait for the invitation” – triggered an aha moment: is that why I’ve had so much trouble with people?! I was hooked.

As usual when something catches my interest, I binged YouTube videos. No clear goals, no strategy, just stuffing myself with “one more video,” following whatever caught my eye in the algorithm’s suggestions. I’m curious and love to investigate – even without clear purpose, just like a butterfly wandering from one flower to another, making funny loops in the air… just because… 🤷‍♂️ probably because it’s more fun than flying straight 😁

Then something hit me – a splenic intuition: 🤔 “This is important. This is a good tool to have in my toolbox.”


## The Realization

The drive to really learn Human Design came from several converging insights:

**Understanding myself:** I’ve always self-analyzed, and from what I’ve discovered, Human Design genuinely seems to be a “user manual” for me, my body, and my life.

**My bigger vision – Eutopia:** In my thinking about how to improve society, education is one of the main pillars (probably the most important). Starting with “know thyself” – mainly understanding our emotions, then others’ emotions (empathy), then learning to communicate efficiently. Human Design is perfect for this – understanding our vehicle and passenger, what happens when we interact with others, and providing a common language for it. Another pillar of my vision is that society should provide everyone with everything they need to develop their full potential – which will in turn benefit society itself, creating a virtuous circle. Here too, Human Design is perfect for understanding how we work, what we love, and the themes we came here to explore.

**Makers Paradise prototype:** In my thinking about Makers Paradise (a kind of prototype living lab for Eutopia), I envisioned it as an X-Men Mansion – where people could develop their true potential. I thought that when arriving, newcomers should first pass through a “detox phase” – to clear all the shit modern society has embedded in people’s minds – a return to basics, to the essence of life and yourself. Human Design is perfect for that. It might even allow something like Professor X did to call and attract all the mutants on Earth.

**Strategic recognition:** I saw several videos about Projectors (my type) saying to focus on one thing and master it… to become recognized for that, to be the “go-to person.” I don’t really like this advice – I’ve always felt more like a generalist, interested in many different things, a jack of all trades… master of none. More like the glue in a team, able to speak with anyone, understanding all the “languages” and translating between them. Anyway, being recognized for _something_ – anything – is probably necessary to fit in the current system where people need to put everyone in a clearly labeled box. I see this as a stepping stone, not a vocation.

But most importantly, I seem to be attracted to this and willing to do it… so I’m just following my excitement and joy, acting to the best of my ability, with no expectation of what the outcome should be. Like a butterfly sucking everything from a flower until feeling like flying somewhere else.


## The Decision: Learning-with-AI-in-Public-by-Teaching

I must have a butterfly soul because it also explains my atypical learning style perfectly.

Reading a book? Boring! From cover to cover in linear fashion? Doesn’t fit the fireworks constantly happening in my mind! What I do instead is more like a butterfly going from flower to flower, losing himself flying higher in the sky for a while, looping playfully around some blooms, revisiting others when thirsty for more.

I surely annoyed my parents as a child with all my constant questioning – wanting to understand how things work… so I could better reverse-engineer them… to make them better (at least according to me 😂). That’s also why I’ve always annoyed people with specific knowledge I’m interested in – trying to pump their knowledge by questioning them. But these days, I think people around me are relieved… thanks to AI.

**AI as learning partner:** It’s the most enjoyable technology I’ve ever experienced! I love my discussions with Claude. No ego, no hidden agenda, no taboos (well, at least not for the kind of topics we cover)… but the best aspect that almost nobody can match: he answers ALL my questions without changing the subject!

But let’s be honest – while interesting for exploration, this isn’t an effective way of learning to reach mastery 🫤 So how could I improve my learning approach?

**Using AI strategically:** Let’s use AI as a personal professor, guide, mentor, coach. But I must remain vigilant – like some human professors I’ve had, he’s brilliant but prone to hallucinations! So I verify his knowledge against certified sources (primarily Ra Uru Hu himself). This verification has positive aspects: it forces critical thinking rather than passive acceptance, builds deeper understanding, and creates annotated knowledge (knowing _why_ something is true, not just that it is).

**The Feynman Technique:** I’ve always loved the idea of “learning by teaching”, based on the idea “if you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough yet.” This is also perfect for “preparing for invitations” – becoming visible for recognition. It could lead to creating educational content I could sell – something I’ve in mind for a while but hadn’t found a topic that truly interested me (which has surely contributed to my decision to master Human Design).

**Learning in Public:** As a developer interested in the startup world, I’ve seen the “build in public” trend and found really interesting. So I came up with “learning in public” – which I later discovered I didn’t invent, I was just unaware of it 🙄 Anyway, this is the perfect incentive to keep me motivated… because I’m not doing this only for myself but also to help others on similar journeys. The beauty of this practice is that it can bring me answers, corrections when I’m wrong, and unexpected insights. Plus, it helps build an audience and recognition.

**The Pedagogy:** Writing a pedagogy came naturally. To guide my learning and collaboration with AI. Also how to teach – which reinforces how I learn. It perfectly aligns with the “learning in public” philosophy and will hopefully provide value for others. Since the end goal of mastering Human Design is understanding a BodyGraph and the person it represents, the pedagogy must include that – which is obviously extremely interesting for learning my own chart.

This combination – _Learning-with-AI-in-Public-by-Teaching_ – ticks all the boxes for me.


## The Experiment: What This Looks Like

Concretely, the process so far has been chaotic… well, it’s an experiment navigating unknown territory 🤷‍♂️

**The journey begins:** Like I explained, I started by binge-watching videos to understand my own design.

**Creating structure:** When taking a step back to really learn Human Design with AI, I did something similar to what I always do when writing big documents (like tech analyses or business plans): write the table of contents first. I’ve always loved what Khan Academy did with their math courses – a dependency graph visually showing what you need to know before learning something new. This inspired my thoughts about education in Eutopia and a huge educational project I’ve had in mind for at least a year. Here’s the opportunity to give it a real test drive.

**The pedagogy spiral:** After that, I needed to define a strategy for writing content – for creating each node of the knowledge graph. Since I’d already written a “teaching philosophy” a year ago, we expanded on it… and got carried away far too far. OK, my bad – I started introducing too many things… and Claude went even _a bit_ further (which he also sometimes does brilliantly – my bad too, it’s partly in the instructions I gave him). Well, long story short, it takes two to tango… with the snowball effect, we drifted far far away! Intellectually very interesting but way too complex and therefore ineffective. So we simplified. OK, it’s part of the experimental process – we learned from our mistakes. That said, these _little_ detours were probably necessary (for me at least) to arrive at the “final for now” version.

**The reality of execution:** So I became really productive and started applying this great pedagogy we’d developed… right? 🫤 Well, like a cat who can’t resist a laser pointer, attracted by the many shiny objects passing through my mind, I got “lost” exploring many different paths 😂 So what did I actually do all this time?

- **Glossary:** A knowledge graph is great, but there are also many terms that must be correctly understood – so I created a glossary.
- **Ecosystem mapping:** To validate Claude’s knowledge, I needed to know who the experts are and what the trusted sources of information are – so I created an ecosystem map and resource list.
- **Human Design in a Nutshell:** I wanted a quick overview of what the complete knowledge graph could look like – so Claude and I created “Human Design in a Nutshell”: the complete Human Design System at Depth 2, in “Bullet Points” style, following the “System Mastery” path.
- **Understanding calculations:** Then I wanted to understand the calculations behind the BodyGraph – and discovered something I hate: some parts of the formula are proprietary 🙄
- **Chart analysis structure:** I thought it would be good to define the structure of a chart analysis (since it’s basically the main goal) – so we worked on that using my BodyGraph. Two birds with one stone. Claude initially understood it as teaching material for students and explained concepts with Human Design jargon. Not what I expected, but an excellent surprise nonetheless. So we also created a “client” version explaining everything without requiring any Human Design knowledge. Very interesting, especially comparing the student and client versions – the same thing explained from two completely different angles. Gold! This will surely be a good source of inspiration for the Feynman Technique approach – Feynman was notorious for his ability to explain very complex subjects with simple language and concrete analogies.
- **BodyGraph calculator:** And then, boom badaboom… different ideas collapsing into the need to calculate many different BodyGraphs myself… The perfect trap for a developer. I knew it was a trap, but oh boy, that cheese looked delicious! I wasn’t Speedy Gonzales – no “¡Ándale! ¡Ándale! ¡Arriba! ¡Arriba!” I lost myself in coding… but I enjoyed it… and it will surely be useful at some point so… 🤷‍♂️

**About learning in public:** I started a while ago, yet I haven’t posted anything! Good news – it’s not impostor syndrome, fear of exposure, or “I need to learn more before sharing.” No, it’s probably simpler: I just don’t have any trigger to share. I don’t know what, how, or when to share – so I just don’t. That’s why I asked Claude to help identify platforms and define a strategy.

**This article:** Then I thought about writing a “first quick article”… which ended in this… taking way more time than expected! It’s already been 4+ hours… but this includes the time we worked on a strategy for writing this kind of content – which will serve me for any content I create, not just for this project. So it’s an investment 😉


## The Why: Personal Alignment

I’ve always been attracted to digging deeper, trying to understand “how it works under the hood,” improving systems, creating new ones, and synthesizing and teaching. Always attracted to diversity, doing and exploring different things, usually at the same time, in parallel. So this multi-faceted experiment ticks all the boxes for me.

**My struggle with clarity:** I’ve always struggled to explain clearly what’s in my mind. Usually because my ideas go in so many directions, twisted like spaghetti in a complex interconnected structure. But let’s face it – when it comes to knowledge, it’s often due to intellectual laziness, being superficial in my learning, obsessed more with visiting as many flowers as possible without taking the time to really know them. Often, I don’t read the manual – I just take a quick peek. That’s why the Feynman Technique is so crucial for me.

That said, there’s probably a good reason for this behavior – explained by my Human Design design. If I lean too much into something, I get sucked into a black hole. I lose myself in rabbit holes where time doesn’t exist.

**Reconnecting with the world:** The mix of teaching and “in public” is also probably what I need right now – to get out of my rabbit hole back into the real world. I’ve always been somewhat lost in life, but especially seven years ago (around 2018) when I decided to stop working until I found something I would really like to do… and I haven’t worked since! This has increased my isolation – feeling even less part of this world, of modern society. But especially this last year, I’ve done intensive personal work… and now may be the time when the sleeping phoenix rises again.

**What this solves:** This experiment could address multiple needs at once: gaining recognition (and perhaps unconscious self-esteem), building a new network (more aligned with who I am and have become), attracting soulmates (collaborators I’m connected with, with whom I have something to build), providing concrete services to others (being actively helpful), and generating revenue from those services to others.


## The How: The Pedagogy

Let me explain the different learning paths this way…

**The territory metaphor:** Imagine the subject you want to learn as a territory to explore. You could explore in the dark, strolling with your little lantern, discovering what’s immediately around you and progressing based on moment-to-moment attraction without any plan. That’s the lost path – close to what I did binge-watching YouTube videos. Interesting for curiosity and general culture, not for real learning.

**The knowledge graph:** A better way is having a map of the territory – with cities, points of interest, and the roads between them. That’s the knowledge graph and glossary. For the nerds, it’s a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) – thanks Claude 😉  
Basically, imagine circles and lines connecting them (jargon: nodes and edges) – see image below. A circle represents a concept, a piece of knowledge about something specific – like division in mathematics or the carburetor in a car. For the lines, there are different types. The most basic is “related” for general relationships, like being part of the same logical group (apple related to fruits, pear related to fruits). For learning purposes, the most important is the “prerequisite” relation – indicating what you need to know to understand this concept. The “unlocking” relation is just the other end of “prerequisites” – a path to what you can learn next.

<div class="text-center">
    <img class="inline-block md:w-1/2" src="/blog/dag.svg" alt="Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)">
</div>

**Four learning paths:** Having that map with points of interest and roads, students become powerfully free. It’s like having a smart GPS that provides the best route for where you want to go according to your mode of travel and mood. We’ve identified four predefined paths:

1. **The Hero’s Journey:** If you’re interested in understanding yourself first, we use your own chart as an entry point to guide you through a personal path.
2. **System Mastery:** If you want to master the subject, we guide you through a depth-first comprehensive path.
3. **Just-in-Time:** If you want immediately useful knowledge, we let you explore based on feelings, motivations, and what you need to know right now.
4. **Choose Your Own Adventure:** The beauty of the knowledge graph is that it allows free, self-directed exploration purely driven by curiosity.

**Depths and dimensions:** Students have a clear view of the whole territory, the points of interest, and the roads connecting them, plus a path for their journey. But we identified two other aspects that provide even more flexibility: depths and dimensions. Depending on your objectives, you don’t necessarily need to understand or want to learn every node at the same depth. This is especially important for “forced prerequisites” – like when you want to know more about X but need Y and Z first. The concept of depth lets you decide whether to spend five minutes, one hour, or just take a quick peek at each painting in the museum. You don’t have to visit every piece sequentially in full depth. You can take just a quick look and return later if needed.

**Depths** are the level of detail:

1. **Essence:** General culture and terminology, or “TL;DR”
2. **Basics:** Core fundamental knowledge
3. **Deep Dive:** Covers the subject in all details
4. **Mastery:** Connecting even the little details and going beyond Human Design itself

**Dimensions** are optional contextual information – for example:

- **Practice:** How this knowledge relates to or can be used in daily life
- **Mechanics:** How this works under the hood
- **Integration:** How this relates to other domains
- **Recreation:** Fun facts, stats, humor, etc.

**Verbosity levels** provide different communication preferences and learning paces:

1. **Bullet points** – slide deck-like
2. **Direct** – focused on substance, not form
3. **Minimal** – polishing a bit the form to be less harsh
4. **Verbose** – literary art for those who love to read _(optional)_

## The Invitation: Join the Journey

If you’re still reading, I guess I didn’t bore you to death 😂 or at least you have some real interest in this.

**What’s in it for you?** If you’re interested in Human Design, education, or just curious about atypical learning and teaching approaches, you might enjoy following along.

**What’s in it for me?** I have a lot to learn in both Human Design and education, so all feedback is welcome. From experts in these fields to help me better understand, discover things “I don’t know I don’t know,” and most importantly, correct me when I’m wrong. From students who use my educational materials – does it help you? Do you enjoy it? What’s better or worse than more traditional materials?

**What can you expect?** Things like this. Open, transparent, honest reporting about my journey – the good and bad, successes and mistakes, discoveries and realizations… and surely some nerdy, boring stuff too (I like to “split hairs in four” as we say in French) 😂

**Where to follow?**

- **[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/humandesign/):** Engaging with community, asking questions, testing hypotheses
    - (Later) Maybe creating a dedicated subreddit

## Living My Design: Already Honoring My Blueprint

Let’s reflect on how this relates to my own chart…

**Investigator (Line 1):** This is my Design imprint. Digging deep into and exploring broadly a subject is what I’m naturally attracted to and where I find peace and joy.

**Opportunist (Line 4):** This is my Personality side. It builds upon the security my 1st line creates and waits for opportunities to embrace community and externalize the foundations, gifts, or discoveries of the lower trigram.

**Projector Strategy:** “Wait for the invitation” – which is confusing. This project is “preparing for invitations.” It’s being visible to allow recognition to happen and invitations to come in. I’m not giving unsolicited advice, just sharing knowledge.

**Splenic Authority:** This is trickier. I guess I started honoring my Personal Authority by following its guidance to begin this journey… without concrete objectives, no plans, no specific projects to apply this to. As I progress on this journey, I try to remain vigilant to catch its subtle in-the-moment yes/no guidance. I think it’s also what gives me the feeling when something is false, going in the wrong direction, or missing something. It’s like navigating in fog where you must learn to trust your instruments. So this is also a good project to experiment with and strengthen my relationship with my Authority.

**Cross of Crisis:** I said I didn’t have real plans or concrete projects, but… my Incarnation Cross of Crisis seems to confirm the big ideas I have about deep transformation for society. These ideas are well-developed in my mind but far from being concretely implementable in the real world. Or perhaps it’s because, as a Projector, I’m not here to do but to guide. That’s surely why I’ve had in mind for years that I need to find my A-Team(s). And if I put my trust in faith, actually taking this leap of faith, this is probably the first step toward the beginning of my “life mission.”

To be continued…
