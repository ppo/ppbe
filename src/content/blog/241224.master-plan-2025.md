## Goal – The Dream Vision

_Come with me, picture this._

It’s the end of 2025, New Year’s Eve, 6pm.

We’re in a magnificent domain in between two worlds – partly in the wilderness, hidden in the middle of the woods – partly in modern society, just outside the mythical city of Florence, Italy.

Today, we’re not celebrating the new year that is coming. Today, we celebrate what was accomplished during 2025. Achievements far bigger than anyone imagined when this journey began!

_Follow the guide…_

First, hard to miss, standing proudly on its pedestal in our midst, our flagship achievement… a normal van?! No, just like James Bond’s cars, appearances can be deceiving. Behind its discreet exterior lies a marvel of technology and craftsmanship, a state-of-the-art camper van. Better still, it’s a work of art! And even more than that, it’s a testament to what happens when expertise, community, and innovation converge.

Every element of this vehicle tells a story of collaboration. Each component represents the best expression of the talents of enthusiasts who came together not for profit, but for the pure joy of creating something extraordinary. Everything, from design to finishing touches, has been questioned and rethought from first principles to imagine all the possibilities, or invent new ones. All supervised by domain experts with constant feedback from the whole community – makers with technical skills and vanlifers with real-world experience – working together for a final result far exceeding the sum of their parts.

_Which brings us to the most important point…_

Look around. The air buzzes with excitement from people from different backgrounds, with their unique personality, coming from all over the world. Listen to them sharing stories of the year’s achievements, reflecting on the problems they faced and managed to overcome together, and laughing remembering all the good times they had during this extraordinary adventure.

They are the real achievement. We’re not dreamers anymore, we are pioneers. We’ve created an ecosystem where expertise flows freely, where “Unity Makes Strength” isn’t just Belgium’s motto, it’s our daily reality. They are a living proof that unity really makes strength.

That’s not even the best. The real revolution came thanks to the manufacturers and our patrons, who enabled us to take money out of the equation. Allowing each and every one of us to have all the resources we need to fully express our talents. Freed from the limitations of imaginary constraints, we could focus on what must be done and do it how it must be done.

Here, everything is open and freely available, we share without restriction, without counting. No zero-sum game. Abundance attracts abundance. We share in abundance and therefore we receive in abundance. It’s a virtuous circle, without end, without limits. And this is just the beginning of the revolution.

_But what would a people be without a homeland? Let’s jump high to have a bird view._

This is ground zero: the starting point where an idea took root, the epicenter of something disruptive and revolutionary. More than just the first prototype of a new kind of collaborative space, it embodies the spirit of a new way of thinking, living, and working together.

Where we are is no hasard. There’s something mystical around this region, it happened again in Florence!

600 years ago, Florence was the birthplace of the Renaissance, the transition from Middle Ages to modernity. It was perhaps the first living laboratory, a place where art and engineering flew as one, where great social change took place in most fields and disciplines. No wonder it seduced one of history’s greatest makers, Leonardo da Vinci.

Today, Florence is again the birthplace of a similar threshold: the dawn of the Unity Age. Infused by the spirit of all the great minds who flourished here, the Makers Paradise is a modern living laboratory for makers of all trades.

This “Eutopia” (meaning “good place") is already spreading around the world – Lisbon, Los Angeles, Vancouver, Sydney… even in unexpected places! In the pure spirit of Unity Makes Strength, the strong help those who need them and so a Makers Paradise is taking shape in the heart of Africa – embracing and amplifying the Ubuntu philosophy that’s already deeply rooted there: “I am because we are.” As local makers use these facilities to improve the quality of life in the villages around, they’re also teaching us profound lessons about how shared success enriches everyone’s lives.

_Hey, you see there? Do you recognize these famous glasses? Yes, it’s the professor._

At the heart of this human adventure is obviously the sharing of knowledge – learning and teaching. In line with Ubuntu: “success and struggle are shared experiences,” we documented everything we did during the journey. Then we produced educational content.

Here too, applying our principles to everything we do, we restarted from scratch. Learning from the bests teachers and applying the latest knowledge in education, we defined a teaching methodology that allows us to provide first-class teaching. Instead of big curriculum, we have a knowledge tree with atomic lessons; and each lesson is available in 3 speeds – as sometimes, you get it fast while other times you need more explanations. So no more long hours classes. Now you learn “just in time” – what you need, when you need it.

Of course, we didn’t stop there. Using modern technologies, we created “The Professor” – an AI that isn’t just another ChatGPT. Sure, it can answer any question and guide you. But The Professor is your personal teacher, your mentor. It knows exactly where you are in your learning journey and can craft on the fly personalized courses tailor-made to you, to what you need to learn now.

Oh. Do I still need to mention that everything is free? Knowledge should always be free… as this is what makes us stronger – and that’s what we want for humanity, right?

_Let’s go still a bit higher… in the could._

For all the unlucky ones who don’t have the chance to be here with us in this physical paradise, we created two digital platforms and communities. One for makers, the other for vanlifers – separated for convenience, yet closely tight together by essence. These were also made “as it should be” thanks to the deep engagement of these communities, or as the saying goes “For X, made by X".

The Makers Platform is the digital counterpart of the Makers Paradise, for collaboration without borders – knowledge and education, sharing and inspiring. Wherever you land on here, if you lack some knowledge, you can easily navigate through our knowledge tree to cherry-pick what you need or want to learn… or just ask The Professor.

Van Life Social is the go-to hub for vanlifers and aspiring ones. It’s a comprehensive ecosystem for the van life community that embraces the true spirit of van life. While city life rushes by in 60-second clips, here we take our time to explore and share all the little details that make each journey unique – for the greatest joy and inspiration of aspiring vanlifers. In the Ubuntu spirit, experienced nomads share their road-earned wisdom, practical knowledge, and yes, even their mistakes and struggles. It has transformed how the van life community connects, supports, and grows together, making the dream of freedom easier to embrace than ever.

_One more thing. Come back into the van._

To end with a tribute to a great visionary and revolutionary, Steve Jobs. Something that would have make him proud.

Remember all those disparate controls and switches that used to clutter van builds? They’re gone. And this is another revolution – not technical but human.

In their place, vanOS, a open-source system that unifies everything – all camper systems and even the vehicle itself. On the surface, it’s the result of a close collaboration between the development team, professional builders and vanlifers. But it’s below the surface that the revolution resides. This was possible thanks to the openness of all the manufacturers who accepted to play the game, to set aside competition, patent-driven mentalities, and proprietary locks.

This is the cornerstone of a new era – where collaboration replaces competition, where unity truly makes strength. The revolution isn’t just in the technology, but in how we created it together.

_Come on, it’s time I brought you back to the present._

What you’ve seen is more than a vision; it’s the beginning of something extraordinary. A revolution in how we work together, how we learn together, how we live together – together in unity.

Are you ready to be part of this? Are you one of those pioneers who will help shape this new era of unity?

The future is calling. Will you answer?


## What & Why – The Grounded Vision

We live in a world of unprecedented technological capability, yet our collaborative potential remains largely untapped. While we can instantly connect with experts worldwide, share knowledge at light speed, and fabricate almost anything imaginable, we’re still held back by outdated systems that promote competition over collaboration and scarcity over abundance.

My hypothesis is simple but powerful: When skilled people unite around a compelling goal, with access to necessary resources and freedom to work as they see fit, they can achieve extraordinary results. This isn’t just theory – it’s the foundation of every major breakthrough in human history, from the Renaissance workshops of Florence to the collaborative triumphs of modern open source.

For 2025, I intent turning this hypothesis into reality through a controlled experiment. Let’s create a living laboratory where passion drives innovation, where expertise flows freely, and where resources follow needs rather than budgets. Through six concrete projects, we’ll demonstrate what becomes possible when unity truly makes strength.

Our testing ground, our living laboratory is the “Makers Paradise” – a dedicated space where creators can fully express their talents without artificial constraints. Here, participants will find:

- A complete ecosystem for living and creating
- Freedom to focus entirely on innovation
- Direct collaboration with industry experts
- Support from the global communities of makers and vanlifers
- Professional-grade tools and workspace

But tools and space alone aren’t enough. We’re implementing a fundamentally different way of working together:

- Sociocratic decision-making that honors every voice while maintaining momentum
- Expert-led autonomous teams guided by mastery, not hierarchy
- Resources flowing to maximize impact, not satisfy spreadsheets
- Open knowledge sharing that accelerates everyone’s progress

The core principle is elegantly simple: Each person brings their unique talents, while the community provides whatever they need to express those talents fully. No bean-counting, no tracking of individual contributions – just people doing their best work, supported by what they need to do it.

This experiment will prove that extraordinary achievements become possible when we remove artificial constraints to unleash human potential. Through our six projects, we’ll demonstrate that the path to innovation isn’t through competition, but through unity. When we trust expertise, support passion, and share resources freely, we don’t just solve problems – we revolutionize how humanity creates together.

<br>
To conclude, here are the seven initiatives of this master plan. Six projects for carrying out one experiment in an interesting, fun, and hopefully intelligent way. Each project plays a vital role and has been carefully designed to both stand alone and strengthen the whole. Each initiative has its own dedicated page to explore it in more details – just click the links to learn more.

## How – The Path Forward

Conventional project plans start with detailed roadmaps and fixed milestones. But when creating something revolutionary – something that’s never been done before – such rigid planning becomes a constraint rather than an enabler.

Our approach is fundamentally different. Think of it as preparing a stage: First, we create the conditions for magic to happen by setting a compelling vision, establishing foundational principles, and building initial infrastructure. Then, we bring together the right people – passionate experts, skilled makers, and motivated dreamers. The specific path forward emerges organically through their collective intelligence and expertise.

This isn’t about lack of direction – it’s about recognizing that the best solutions will come from our community’s combined wisdom. The sociocratic structure ensures every voice is heard while maintaining momentum. My role is to set and maintain the vision, propose frameworks for collaboration, prepare fertile ground for growth, and build initial momentum.

Let’s explore each element of my role, starting with the foundation: setting the vision. This master plan serves as our North Star – not just describing where we’re going, but establishing the philosophy that will guide us there. It outlines the future we want to create and the principles that will help us achieve it. While the specific paths may evolve as our community grows, this vision provides the gravitational center that keeps us aligned and moving in the same direction.

With the vision established, we need effective ways to work together. I’ve identified these core methodologies that should help us move smoothly and quickly in the right direction. [Theory U](theory-u-overview) will guide us in leading from the emerging future, while [Sociocracy](sociocracy-overview) provides a robust framework for inclusive decision-making. [Design Thinking](design-thinking-overview) offers proven approaches for tackling complex challenges, and [Modern Software Development](modern-software-development) principles ensure we maintain agility and momentum. I’ve written detailed explorations of each methodology – just click the links to learn more.

To prepare fertile ground for this vision to take root, I’ll lay out clear starting points for key aspects of our journey. For each project, I’ll share initial visions and high-level objectives that can serve as springboards for collective refinement. I’ll outline approaches to governance and organization, different levels of collaboration, and what we’re looking for in potential collaborators. I’ll explain how I envision sponsorship that transcend traditional models, becoming true collaborative partnerships. I’ll share my vision about education in general – the education system I would have loved to grow into. Perhaps most importantly, I’ll address the elephant in the room: how we’ll navigate the paradox of building a “moneyless” experiment within our current “moneyfull” system (funding, revenues, compensations, budgeting, payments, accounting).

Finally, we need to build initial momentum. This master plan aims to rally dreamers who want to become pioneers, and the first step is activating the most fundamental level of Unity Makes Strength: word of mouth. To catalyze this, I’ll provide ready-made content that makes sharing effortless – if you lack time or inspiration for your own words, just share this with friends and audience. Beyond simple sharing, I’ll invite people to create their own content about this vision – filming videos or writing articles. They can share why they’re excited, how they want to participate, what they expect from this adventure… or even why they think it’s doomed to fail. All perspectives are valuable.

To build social proof and gauge interest, I’ll create a simple RSVP and waitlist system where people can indicate their level of enthusiasm – from “🤩 Definitely!” to “🙄 Surely not!” This will evolve into a more comprehensive platform where interested individuals can create detailed profiles, sharing their motivations, skills they bring, areas they want to learn, and their aspirations for this journey. This way, as the momentum builds, we’ll also start mapping the collective capabilities and dreams of our emerging community.


## Hidden Symbolism?

Summarizing what this master plan is about, I wrote:

- Projects: Collaborative Van Build, Makers Paradise, Makers Platform, Van Life Social, The Professor, vanOS
- Principles: Unity Makes Strength, Beyond Money, Joy as Compass, Open by Default, Sovereign Creation, Connected Growth
- Methodologies: Theory U, Sociocracy, Design Thinking, Agile, Scrum, Lean Startup

666… The number of the beast! 😱 Actually, it is associated with human imperfection, while 777 represents divine perfection.

Is there some hidden meaning here? This project is all about transformation, about transitioning to a new age, about transcending these 6s to produce 7s – from human imperfection to divine perfection.

From 666 (Human Starting Point):

- 6 concrete projects (physical manifestation)
- 6 guiding principles (mental framework)
- 6 practical methodologies (operational approach)

To 777 (Divine Integration):

- The 7th project: The experiment itself – what – a unifying whole, the living transition
- The 7th principle: Unity – why – individual to collective, the one is the all
- The 7th methodology: Bashar’s Formula – how – follow your joy, at every moment, to the best of your ability, with zero expectation of the outcome

Is that perfect or what?! 😀

---

**So, in short, this master plan is:**

- **What:** A living laboratory centered around six interconnected projects demonstrating how unity transforms human potential into extraordinary achievements.
- **Why:** To pioneer a transition from competition to unconditional collaboration, demonstrating how “Unity Makes Strength” can transform not just how we build things, but how we work, learn, and innovate together.
- **How:** By gathering dreamers from all skills and backgrounds, aligning them towards a common goal, and giving them the freedom to unleash their power.

Tell everyone.  
No seriously – tell EVERYONE!
