### 05 Jan

Will everything go that fast in 2026?! 😳

First day, first hour… Things didn’t go well at the Fab Farm 🫤 The owner and I didn’t go along, at all!  
So my “makers journey” won’t happen there… and my Master Plan 2026 is already completely perturbed 🙄

I left Sicily/Italy in a hurry for that, driving (almost) straight to South of Portugal… and now what?! 🤷‍♂️🤔  
On the positive side, the weather is way better here 😀

**What should I do next? Where should I go? 🤔**  
Look for other places like the Fab Farm? 🔮 _No._  
Focus on Unity Playground #0! 🔮 _Yes._  
Find a coworking space around. 🔮 _Yes._

🔮 _No need to rush, let’s integrate that heavy blow.  
This café is nice, let’s come back here tomorrow.  
Then let’s enjoy the South-West tip of Portugal under this magnificent sun._


**Evening reflection…**

<blockquote class="unstyled">
Today, I experienced a full range of sympathy, empathy, kindness, and compassion.

Starting in the morning with a complete absence at Fab Farm. A macho Mediterranean man (Portuguese), egocentric, completely cold and closed-minded, with an emotional quotient probably close to zero. Unbelievable! Not mean, rather nice “in his own way”… but what a huge gap with me! 😳

At noon, an American woman in a thrift/charity shop. Smiling even when she wasn’t smiling, welcoming even without doing anything, and sincerely seeking to help her customers.

And finally, in the afternoon, wow! 🤩 I’ve never had such a welcome in a café! The most striking thing wasn’t even what she said or did, it was her “energetic non-verbal communication” – her gaze and smile too. The exact opposite of the guy in the morning! She radiated such sincere, deep, pure “Love”. (She’s from Eastern Europe but had studied at an international school, with a “so British” lovely accent that I thought she was!)

I still can’t believe I experienced such a wide range of emotions in a single day. And needless to say which experience I preferred 😉

This helped me realize what I want for “my” Unity Playgrounds. Unity, togetherness, collaboration start with that. I think that’s what happens naturally when you help/encourage people to be truly who they are, to open up fully without fear, and to do what they really want to do… after allowing them to decondition themselves. Hence my clever name for Unity Playgrounds, “R&D”… living labs for Reconditioning & Discovery 😁

### 06 Jan

My very first plan of the year has fallen through. It was supposed to take up most of my time. So big slap in my face!

That’s surely another “crisis” – cf. my Human Design “Cross of Crisis” life’s purpose 🤷‍♂️ – more on that below…

Today, I stayed at the same café, procrastinating on my computer 🫤  
And left to be at a nice place ([Forte De Almádena](https://maps.app.goo.gl/V91eqWBhjxZvetdt9)) to watch the sunset [📸](https://www.instagram.com/p/DTLzwW_jMPP/).


### 07-09 Jan

OK, let’s take it easy and wander in the south of Portugal waiting for the crisis to pass.

**Wednesday:** I walked “head in the clouds” on the extreme south edge at the [Fortress of Sagres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortress_of_Sagres).  
_Access: 10€! For what?! Just to be authorized to walk there. Theft! But I was lucky 🙄 As the building inside was closed, it was half price. Still not worth it! Anyway, it was a nice walk/rest time 🤷‍♂️_

**Thursday:** I did a quick hike around Zambujeira do Mar [📸](https://www.instagram.com/p/DTTbcJJjHHD/).

**Friday:** I decided to settle for a month. I subscribed to a coworking space and gym.


### 10 Jan

Back to the gym 💪  
Great, the owner knows how and will help me fix my shoulder – a tendinitis that I’ve been dealing with for 6 months.  
First impression: he seems to know better than the physical therapist I saw in Brussels 🤞

I shopped healthy foods and prepared my environment for next week.


### 11 Jan

I processed this week with Claude (configured for my “[Learning-with-AI-in-Public-by-Teaching Human Design](human-design-learning-with-ai-in-public-by-teaching)” experiment).

The conversation crystallized what was really happening: this wasn’t a failed plan – it was my Cross of Crisis doing exactly what it’s designed to do. I’m here to live through and embody crisis as a transformative force. Not to create drama, but to be the crisis catalyst that forces evolution.

I walked into Fab Farm with a Generator-style plan (“I’ll volunteer, be productive, gain maker experience”) and my Splenic Authority immediately screamed: “NOT THIS! Wrong energy. Recalibrate.”

The progression on Jan 5 was mind-blowing:

- **Morning (Fab Farm):** Complete energetic mismatch → Splenic NO
- **Noon (thrift shop):** Genuine warmth → Splenic appreciation
- **Afternoon (café):** Pure recognition/resonance → Splenic YES

That contrast experience – from the owner’s complete absence of connection to the café woman’s pure recognition – showed me the actual frequency Unity Playgrounds need to embody. Not productivity spaces, but environments for authentic human connection and deconditioning. Like I said above:

Classic 4/1 Projector: investigate experientially (Line 1), then share through my network (Line 4) what authentic Unity energy feels like.

This led to adapting my Coronation Source Code for my Human Design chart. Worked until very late in the morning! And it was worth it – I’m very happy with the result 😀
