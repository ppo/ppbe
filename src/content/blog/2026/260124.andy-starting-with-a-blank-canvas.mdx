## The Wake-Up Call

Two days ago, I published [Project JARVIS – Building My Self OS](project-jarvis-building-my-self-os) – a comprehensive vision for creating my personal operating system powered by AI dream teams.

Then yesterday: _Wait. Am I on the right track or going astray once again?_

Classic me: Exciting vision ⇒ big plans ⇒ over-engineering and jumping into investigation… before even starting 🙄

The track was right but the approach was wrong – trapped in over-analysis (old habits) and scattered by butterfly investigations (unconscious design). Fortunately, this time I noticed it quickly.


## The New Approach

Two complementary ideas surfaced:

1. Create a tool for users to drive development by saying "I want `this`, `here`, `because`".
2. Start extremely lean – explain the vision, zero features, one question: "what do you want here?"

Today, I'm applying this to myself:  
**Let's start with a blank canvas and I'll add features as needs appear, with targeted investigation.**

Concretely, the new plan is:

1. ✅ Write the vision and explain the context – see below
2. ✅ Create a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ppo/andy)
3. ✅ Initialize Claude Code
4. Add needed features in the [backlog](https://github.com/ppo/andy/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Afeature)
5. Implement features based on my most important needs


## The Vision

_The vision remains unchanged – just better formulated._

**Andy is your Self OS** – an AI-powered system structuring how you capture, process, organize, retrieve, and act on ideas and information.

**Andy is your exobrain** – an exoskeleton augmenting, enabling, assisting, and enhancing your mental capacities.

Andy is your **second brain** and an army of **specialized skilled AI agents**.

Andy is your:

- **[J.A.R.V.I.S.](https://youtu.be/Qav7NJIsKL4?t=2s)** – anticipates needs, manages complexity, always available
- **[Pepper Pots](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxeUrUJNnsdf6yZYfUpaF9DWVyNJ8FiiOJ)** – organizes chaos, keeps you focused, handles what you shouldn't
- **[MacGyver](https://youtu.be/Vn9pI-KTkQA)** – improvises solutions from whatever's available
- **[A-Team](https://youtu.be/UAO2JBjRRBk?t=16s)** – specialized skills working together, squad for impossible cases
- **whatever-you-need** – a Genie with unlimited wishes!


#### Why Andy?

- 1986: Les Rita Mitsouko started singing ["Hey, Andy? Hé, Andy!"](https://youtu.be/Ae-tP-rFJl0)
- 1996: I was listening to that song a lot in a lot of university parties
- 2006: [Anne Hathaway](https://youtu.be/0vLp-roIlIw) 😍 played Andy Sachs in "The Devil Wears Prada"
- 2016: Google unveiled the ["Hey Google"](https://youtu.be/w87fOAG8fjk?t=4840) wake word ⁽¹⁾
- 2026: I'm starting this project

⁽¹⁾ _That's actually wrong but how I remember it. Apple introduced "Hey Siri" in 2014 and Google "OK Google" in 2016. Anyway, 2016 fits better in this chronology_ 😉


## The Context

The problems that triggered this journey:

- **I've way too many things floating around in my mind!**
    - I need centralized information and a single gateway.
    - I need collaborators… even multiple teams – but I've no money.
- **My Notion is a mess** accumulated over many years.
    - I still have notes and data in multiple other apps.
    - I struggle to retrieve all the information I know I've somewhere.
    - I struggle to create structured final knowledge and plans.
- **Collaborating with Claude doesn't scale** to my needs.
    - 1300+ Notion pages can't connect to Projects effectively.
    - Multiple interconnected projects need reconciliation.
    - Current tools create friction instead of flow.

**The realization** that made me started:

- Claude has the potential to finally be able to have what I've always dreamed of.
- Claude can be my assistant, collaborator, mentor… even my dream team!
- So I could finally free the Tony Stark I've trapped in me for way too long 😁
